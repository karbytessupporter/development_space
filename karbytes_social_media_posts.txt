Until the vast majority of vehicles on the roadways around me are entirely electric or otherwise not powered by combusting petroleum (and until all meat procured by humans is entirely cultured rather than obtained by slaughtering or maiming animals with nervous systems capable of feeling fear and pain), I am condemning the majority of humans in my midst as too physically abusive to my person (especially in the form of routinely pumping cancer-causing chemicals into the air which I breathe) to regard as anything but burdens to me at best (because I consider myself (at least temporarily) to be intertwined with and highly dependent on Earth's biosphere for my survival and well-being). In my opinion, very few humans genuinely do things which make their existence non burdensome to me. Shame on you! Most of you humans will get no sincere praise from me until (and unless) radical societal change in the ways I specified occurs. #end_fossil_fuels #go_vegan #protect_ecosystems

As a follow-up to my previous tweet, I propose that all petroleum-powered (including hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles) civilian-owned vehicles be irrevocably impounded and that the former owner of each of such impounded vehicle be issued a lifetime pass to use self-driving emissions-free vehicle taxis for up to 100 miles free per day in order to make up for that "loss" (and that person can pay for additional miles as needed). I would also mandate that the same remediation be applied to civilians who own cars which do not have the autopilot override feature which enables the car to become self-driving when that car's artificial intelligence system predicts that an accident is about to occur (especially given the fact that human reflexes are comparatively slow and humans tend to be prone to reckless driving due to their emotionally volatile and egotistical nature). Those who live inside their vehicles or otherwise use their private vehicles as a place to do "private" activities should be given low-cost (if not free) housing units which are not mobile homes and which meet modern safety and ecological standards. #approaching_zero_driving_accidents #clean_air_vehicles #dignified_living_quarters

As a follow-up to the two tweets which I tweeted yesterday, I propose the following addition or alternative to what I suggested in those tweets: that all exhaust pipes on petroleum powered cars be required to release all exhaust inside of the vehicle.

Legally and even culturally speaking, there is (seemingly) no upper limit to how large the human population is allowed to become (in terms of how many (live) human individuals there are simultaneously inhabiting human civilization between "now" and any arbitrary temporal "point" in "the future") but there is always a "hard limit" to how many of those people are allowed to thrive and even survive past what is considered to be "reproductive age" for a human individual.
