Lately (especially this year) I have been becoming more accustomed to the intuitive or speculative hypothesis I have that all reality really is just imagined by exactly one source of intelligence (and how everything I know to be real objects in my life are actually figments of a dream (and that dream in particular is literally all that karbytes actually is (and what karbytes actually is takes the literal form of a simulated universe))).

That might seem self-centered and naive of me to suggest, but I noticed an eerie accumulation of coincidences and other thematic elements of my recent experiences which make it seem like I am literally the rendering of a simulated universe which takes place from the perspective of exactly one apparently humanoid vantage.

The reason why I say that such an idea is self-centered and naive (in an unsettling and potentially unethical way) is that such an "ideology" contextualizes all phenomena I am aware of existing as being conjured up exclusively for my own benefit and soley within my own solipsistic frame of reference. 

Such a perspective seems neutral to the idea of free will (but I feel strongly inclined due to extensive logical analysis and empirical testing to take the uncomprimising perspective of a hard determinist (even though I find it somewhat empowering and "politically correct" to endorse a compatibilistic perspective (or, more accurately, ideology) due to the fact that a compatibilistic worldview purports that free will exists as variable degrees of conscious control which an information processing agent experiences and wields as a tool for manipulating how that agent's experience unfolds in accordance to that agent's goals and desires)).

The reason why I tend to say that I am a hard determinist instead of a compatibilist is that I think there are forces beyond my own humanoid nervous system which act on that nervous system (even if that nervous system and encompassing physical environment is ultimately entirely a highly-detailed simulation).

This journal entry does not seem to provide any obvious benefits to readers of this journal entry other than mere entertainment or potentially relevant clues to help the reader refine its own knowledge.
