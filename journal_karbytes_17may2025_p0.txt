karbytes: "Perhaps the only goal I have which is impossible for me to not accomplish is the goal of creating and maintaining a 'sacred space' of pure awareness within my own ego (i.e. emergent 'center of narrative gravity' arising from rudimentary physical processes within my human body and perhaps also cybernetic augmentation to my human body) which I can take pleasure in residing in; a portable 'room' where karbytes lives and emerges from and which is always an essential component of karbytes (and perhaps everything else)."

karbytes: "While going on long immersive hiking or camping retreats into the wilderness, I often prefer to be entertained just by the qualia which emerges within my sensory and cognitive 'field' which I do not 'preload' in the form of books, music, or other socio-cultural 'trappings' (e.g. human or non-human chaperone, live-streaming video or audio coverage of my entire trip). I always seem to happen upon the same conclusion each time I venture out into the wilderness with as minimal infrastructural support as I can stand: Nature never fails to provide ample things to intrigue, inspire, and scare me. Hence, there is never a dull moment for me in the fertile 'vacuum' that is unadulterated nature."
