To make a long story short, I was talking with ChatGPT-4o earlier today about my hypothetical future financial, housing, and employment situation and got a rejuvinated sense of inspiration and hope to continue pursuing a career in Information Technology (even though I dropped out of college and have scant work experience (not to mention a serious criminal record)). 

I think that, if I manage to build a new alternate online identity which is strictly professional rather than personal or smacking of ideology (or even of bragging about what a great philosopher, artist, intellectual, or humanitarian I think I am or think I can convince others I am), I might actually become quite successful as an Information Technology specialist. 

What ChatGPT recommended I do is obtain modern IT certifications which are free or low-cost and available online during the next three to six months and then apply for relevant jobs. Such jobs seem to pay more than other jobs I have been considering such as warehouse, food handling, and even cashier jobs. Also, IT jobs are often flexible such that some of the work can be done remotely (though I prefer to have a designated place other than my home or some cafe with Wi-Fi that pertains to my paid work because such an environment filters out most of the distractions and other aspects I find unsavory about human civilization). 

I can easily pretend to be someone other than karbytes (even as the successor to the karbytes I currently am) and give myself a different brand name and website. My new (professional only) website can contain coding examples from my current websites (i.e. Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) along with more industry-relevant portfolio projects and IT certifications (obtained by taking online courses and/or passing certification exams).

There seem to be at least two separate personalities within me competing for dominance over usage of my cognitive resources. One of those personalities is relatively primitive, survival-obsessed, dumb, antisocial, paranoid, and maybe even feral. The other personality is relatively cultured, modern, optimistic, technologically-savvy, socially astute, politically correct (at least in outward presentation), and patiently hard-working enough to easily land an IT job (or so it seems). Perhaps forces beyond my control are at play making it hard for me to get an IT job (or any job for that matter). I really don't know for sure, but I prefer to entertain both personalities because I think they both have something worthwhile to contribute. I will probably outwardly present myself as being more like the cultured version while keeping the feral version mostly private or anonymous.

(To be clear, what I meant by the term "politically correct" is adhering to conventions of speech, behavior, and appearance which seem to align with relevant corporate or societal cultures and policies (without forsaking my strongly-held personal convictions). I did not mean to use that term to imply that I am openly aligned with any particular political party nor religion. My goal is to make my professional avatar seem very apolitical and secular (but without being an intellectual snob about it)).
