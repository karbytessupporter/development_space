In the previous journal entry which I wrote (and which is named journal_karbytes_19may2025_p1.txt), I said that I planned on burning at least one M_DISC containing all the files in the private GitHub repository named karbytes_basement_36 (as that repository is configured at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 19_MAY_2025). When I got home from my hike at Las Trampas Wilderness (and I live in Castro Valley, California near the edge of that large expanse of rolling hills covered in oak trees and California fescue grass savannahs which is connected to Las Trampas Wilderness on the north end), I realized that I had burned all the M_DISCs that I had in my latest spindle with karbytes2025_12 (but I had another spindle of ten blank 25 gigabyte capacity M_DISCs on its way to the local Amazon locker within 24 hours). I now have that spindle of blank M_DISCs and the hard cover copy of "The Biggest Ideas in the Universe: Quanta and Fields" by Sean Carroll (2024) which I ordered from Amazon dot Com this weekend. I also bought a cheap college-ruled paper notebook and a pack of four black gel pens so that I can take notes while reading that book and do math problems. The paper is not long-term archival quality, but I intend on taking digital photographs of some of my best hand-written notes to include in karbytes for an indefinitely long time (and it should be known that karbytes has the ambitious goal of preserving itself for an infinitely long time (where, as time elapses after a certain point in time which is already in what I know to be "the past", karbytes never shrinks in data size but it has the potential to keep amassing more digital content (and each chapter (as soon as I deem it to be finalized (typically as soon as I burn and read the first M_DISC containing the latest complete backup of karbytes) is intended to remain immutable forever after that point in my timeline and in that intellectual property collection's timeline (which overlap starting at the aforementioned point in what I know to be "the paste" when karbytes was officially established as an identifiable entity))))).

Instead of creating an M_DISC containing a folder named karbytes19may2025_beta like I said I would in journal_karbytes_19may2025_p1.txt, I will create an M_DISC containing a folder named karbytes20may2025_beta which contains all the files in karbytes2025_12 and all the files in karbytes_basement_36 at the point in my timeline (which is also now also the karbytes intellectual property's timeline) labeled 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_MAY_2025 (and I intend to burn that disc between 2:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_MAY_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_MAY_2025).
