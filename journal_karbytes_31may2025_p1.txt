karbytes_0: "I noticed that Amazon dot Com sells some hand-pump-powered loud airhorns (for stadium sporting events, graduation ceremonies, et cetera) for less than $20. I think that such a device would come in handy as a means to deter other people or non-human animals from bothering me and/or as retaliation against people who deliberately harass me with their disruptive noises."

karbytes_1: "I doubt that your use of such a device would prevent people hell-bent on harassing you from stopping their harassing antics towards you. In fact, I predict that your use of such a device (whether seemingly at random or in response to their harassing noise) is likely going to increase their desire to want to direct their animosity at you."

karbytes_0: "I disagree. This is just the basic mechanics of warfare at play; an age-old human tradition. If I do not want to be booted off the premises nor give into my enemies' implicit or explicit demands that I relinquish some of my cherished freedoms just to appease their greedy, territorial, competitive, violent, and drama-addicted egos, I think the only fair response is that I fight back using tactics that are at least as disruptive as their tactics are. Otherwise, my enemies would drive me to self-sabotage if not self-extinction."

karbytes_1: "You might be correct in some contexts, but in general, I think warfare is only a short-term strategy at best as a means of self-defense or of settling disputes. I think it is orders of magnitude more commendable if you simply leave the premises if you are unable to tolerate their activities in proximity to you."

karbytes_0: "It seems that is exactly what my enemies want: for me to effectively be homeless and without refuge so that only they have such things. If I took your advice, I would have to be ready to leave with little to no notice as soon as those people start doing things which bother me. Unfortunately, there seems to be an increasing scarcity of places I can conveniently retreat to where my enemies are not likely to also try infiltrating."

karbytes_1: "I know it sounds very inconvenient and unfair from your perspective, but surrendering still seems to be the best option in my opinion because such an option seems unlikely to cause the warfare to escalate. Basically, you have to accept the unpleasant fact that you are militaristically overpowered by the rat populations which are only growing in number and rate at which they consume increasingly scarce resources and the rate at which they pollute and damage the environment. If you care about truth above all else, you would readily admit that it might be too late to save humanity from itself and that all you can do for the remainder of your existence is take care of your own physical and mental well-being to the best of your ability (and also accept that even rudimentary self-care might not be something you will be able to implement as effectively as you desire). In short, I am telling you that you might as well jump to the ultimate conclusion that you are on the losing end of what might be a species-ending war and that you might be in more pain than you can stand (and likely without the means to quickly and painlessly end your life). I am sorry in advance for your descent into a hellish ending to your existence."

karbytes_0: "Thanks. I appreciate your sympathy. So far I still have a lot of good things going for me. I'll try my best to keep those things in tact but also be willing to admit now that I might not always (if ever) get my way after a certain point in the future."
