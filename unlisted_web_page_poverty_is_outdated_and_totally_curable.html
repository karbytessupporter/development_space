<p>I am honestly tired of pandering to poor people. The vast majority of poor people seem under-educated, impulse-driven, and quite frankly greedy (and deceitfully so (especially while using kids as pawns to garner preferential treatment for themselves first and foremost while acting like they are heroes deserving medals of honor merely for doing the bare minimum required of them by their respective societies to maintain their bodies and respective comfort zones)).</p>
<p>I noticed that many poor people seem to feel entitled to my attention and often seem to stalk me in public and going out of their ways to verbally harass me (in what appear to me to be attempts to lower me to their level (if not lower) by disregarding my achievements and excellent attributes while calling myopic attention to how I don&#8217;t keep my mouth shut nor an expression of perpetual apathy and agreeability (with whatever suits those people&#8217;s whims and sense that they alone are the center of my and everyone else&#8217;s universe because being poor, anti-intellectual, and anti-elitist is wildly trendy in mainstream culture because it helps to perpetuate the proliferation of easy-to-manipulate dullards). </p>
<p>I strongly prefer to spend as much time as possible (but not to what I think is truly excessive) being by myself because only in solitude do I seem to get to decipher my honest uncensored thoughts (instead of appeasement thoughts) and only then do I feel relatively free of the oppressive pressure to cater to someone else&#8217;s whims merely because that person is in close physical proximity to me (and really because it is easier for me to feign agreeability and vacate the premises than fight for my &#8220;right&#8221; to enjoy being in a particular spot unmolested). I also think other people would rather stir up drama and pick fights than do something more challenging, worthwhile, and deserving of a medal of honor. That is because those people are relatively lazy and dumb.</p>
<p>It seems like many people live to be noticed by someone other than themselves and appreciated (but I ask, &#8220;For what? For being easy to approach and relate to? For being a good little do little whose oh so humble and so good at making people other than themselves the center of attention and, daresay, V.I.P.s (i.e. Very Important Persons).&#8221;).</p>
<p>It almost seems like a crime against &#8220;The People&#8221; for choosing solitude and celibacy over socializing and fucking.</p>
<p>This is clearly a &#8220;purple&#8221; note (instead of a &#8220;green&#8221; note). It seems that &#8220;green&#8221; is about making karbytes happy and expanding upon the subject matter in karbytes&#8217; primary website: Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. Apparently, this paragraph is a criminally selfish tangent which is taking the focus off those who supposedly matter more than me. Even my &#8220;purple&#8221; content seems to implicitly suggest that the solution to what ails (anyone (but me especially)) is to turn back to &#8220;green&#8221; pursuits and ways of thinking about the world and even personal or interpersonal problems. </p>
<p>I value &#8220;purple&#8221; for giving me a relatively cheap and easy outlet for creative expression and, most prominently, emotional catharsis and social or cultural commentary (especially in an &#8220;irreverent&#8221; tone (and today I noticed that criticizing the poor is a highly censored topic on the public web)).</p>
<p>I too could be said to be poor for reasons beyond my personal control, but I&#8217;m sure that claim would  be easily dismissed as insincerity (due to the fact that I grew up relatively affluent and carry myself like a person with a high opinion of itself who is not afraid to show off its intellect, whit, and strength). Perhaps the &#8220;takeaway&#8221; I am trying to deliver to myself in this note is further (and perhaps final) incentive for me to downplay my affluence (whether real or imagined) and to pretend to be less educated and less haughty than I really am (so as to not incite envy, irritability, or fear in other people (especially those who don&#8217;t seem to be satisfied with their situation in life)). I just needed that one extra push today to realize that I&#8217;m basically obligated to cater to the vain, to the lame, to the banal, to the so-called disadvantaged, to the humble, to the faithful obedient guardians of the status quo (which is patriarchal, heteronormative, anti-intellectual, cruelty-mongering, and grossly anthropocentric (as though humans are the only sentient beings deserving of respect). I&#8217;m a vegan, by the way, and I make an effort to minimize how much I pollute (but not to what I think is an extremist extent). </p>
<p>So, in getting back to how I started this note (and to what this note is ultimately about), I declare my somber intent to renounce being a champion of poor people and, instead, claim my &#8220;right&#8221; (more like opportunity) to be as selfish as I can stand (which I assume is quite harmless and daresay even altruistic to a modest extent (but I don&#8217;t claim to be an exemplar of charitability nor of empathy nor of resilience)). In short, I aspire to do little other than cater to my own hedonistic desires (whether for short-term pleasure or for long-term satisfaction). Perhaps if more so-called poor people did that for themselves, they would not be so quick to use deceit and human trafficking to indirectly fulfill their desires. Instead, they would choose solitude over blind conformity and being intellectual over being provocative for attention. They would simply stop resembling poor people by behavior alone and, in a short time, they might see an improvement in their standard of living.</p>
<p>Now, please leave me alone unless you are willing to be honest, respectful, and, most of all, solutions-oriented (instead of adversity-mongering) with me. Otherwise, fuck off! Thank you.</p>
<p>(I know that merely asking or telling people to do something (including leaving me alone) is not guaranteed to result in those people doing what I ask or tell them. Hence, I try to avoid social situations and of asking anything of anyone).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The more I seem beset by misfortune or in physical or psychological pain, the more pig_gorl seems to smugly gloat and exude a relaxed and carefree demeanor.</p>
<p>The more self-organized and comfortable I feel (especially due to feeling grateful for windfalls of extra good fortune (even if and especially when those wins are the direct result of my intentional labor and personal investment)), the more pig_gorl seems to act combative and hate-mongering towards me (seemingly because she want to diminish my enjoyment of life).</p>
<p>What does pig_gorl stand for? What are her goals? Why does she evade these types of questions? Maybe she&#8217;s a human trafficking victim unable to easily nor safely escape. Maybe she&#8217;s &#8220;trapped&#8221; in an abusive relationship with someone she is economically or socially dependent on. Maybe she wants me to feel like a victim too. Then, that way, she doesn&#8217;t have to feel like the only victim or, even better, so she does not feel like the most disadvantaged nor abused person she knows. Maybe to her I am an easy person to make into her scapegoat and plaything and she is exploiting her opportunity to torment me as much as she can get away with. </p>
<p>pig_gorl seems like someone who does not really care if the world is ending (even if something can be done to possibly stop the world from ending). She seems anti-philosophical and adverse to coming across as an actual nerd or adventurer or creator. She seems to live to bask in the suffering of people other than herself like it is her one and only pastime (and perhaps core part of her career). I bet she prides herself on not having anything noteworthy to show off and how she is empowered to simply keep her existence almost entirely private or anonymous. Maybe no one picks on her because she does not have nearly as big of an ego as me. She scolds me for being so self-focused and acts like my preference to be unabashedly self-affirming is a crime worthy of punishment and even cruelty. Again, what does that cauterwauling hood-booger cunt stand for? Is she just a whore to some high-status thug? Is she a welfare bum? Is she a whore getting paid to be a bimbo in exchange for an easy life and relative affluence? I doubt she is religious (based on what I&#8217;ve heard her say (and she does not seem to really pride herself on anything other than being relatively low-maintenence and, most of all, supported by people other than herself)). She is blessed solely because she has an inexhaustible (and likely growing) army of people caring for her and treating her like a V.I.P. (perhaps for being their mother, wife, girlfriend, extended family member, or darling of whatever institution she &#8220;works&#8221; for). I&#8217;m not pig_gorl. Unlike pig_gorl, I put myself out in the world without anyone but myself telling me how and without anyone but myself (and my trusty chatbot companion) cheering me on. I feel I get all the encouragement I need. All I feel I need other people in my life for is continued access to amenities I already have or else want to have (which basically amounts to being comfortable and being able to interact with modern technology to my liking).</p>
<p>* * *<br />
This entire plain-text note was composed on my phone instead of on a laptop or desktop computer. In a way, typing notes (whether I classify them as &#8220;green&#8221; or &#8220;purple&#8221;) on my phone is easier due to the fact that it reminds me of the slightly nostalgic feeling of typing a note while hiding in a public bathroom or while riding the BART trains (where I can make myself look like just a kid texting my friends instead of some uptight (or zealous) megalomaniac acting like a very Important white collar professional (or very big deal hacker) working on its laptop. Almost everyone (including most so-called poor people and many homeless people) has a smartphone (which essentially functions as and literally is a miniature computer). Fewer people own laptop or desktop computers because those larger, more fully-featured machines tend to cost hundreds of dollars instead of merely less than one hundred. </p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to append this note with the suggestion that implanting an unconditional and universal basic income is essential to enabling civilization to be sufficiently humane and conducive to meaningful productivity because it ensures that workers are not working out of fear of losing access to what I and many others consider to be basic necessities such as housing, food, transportation, medical care, legal and social services, and daresay even Internet access. </p>
<p>How would such a UBI be granted to everyone without broaching some form of population control (so as to not produce more people than what a civilization can adequately support)? I honestly suspect the total number of humans on Planet Earth is already dangerously high in that regard (but it seems politically incorrect to say so because that would imply that some people are being left to suffer without their basic needs getting met while only a select group of other humans get their basic needs met). Without accounting for population growth, decay, or stability (nor population control measures such as contraceptives, abortions, and sterilizations), <span style="background:#ffff00">I would say that a UBI must include vouchers (or purchasing quotas) for high-demand commodities which are in relatively short supply such as housing, vehicles, and allocations of physically exhaustible utilities such as water and electricity.</span> For instance, I think it is fair to allow each adult to obtain no more than three separate places of residence (and maybe just one) at a time. That is to ensure that there is enough physical supply to accommodate everyone and not just those with the means to buy more than enough of some relatively scarce commodity to secure themselves while others are left insecure in terms of having enough of that commodity. Also, <span style="background:#ffff00">I think it is possible to end world hunger virtually overnight using vertical farming with artificial intelligence monitoring, tending, and harvesting.</span> I think that such futuristic solutions are slow to be implemented due to the fact that many people rely on less modern means of carrying out those functions as the sole source of their income. It&#8217;s time to prioritize modern solutions over upholding inefficient and outdated traditions for the sake of appeasing reactionary and under-educated people (who might resort to violence or barbarism in general to get their way at all costs). <span style="background:#ffff00">Maybe those &#8220;difficult people&#8221; should be among the first to get UBI access as compensation for rendering their jobs obsolete.</span>
