On 19_FEBRUARY_2024 at approximately 11:00AM Pacific Standard Time, karbytes ordered two fireproof zip-locking compact disc cases and two sets of three M_DISCs from Amazon dot Com. 

karbytes plans on burning three new copies of karbytes_23february2024_core and three copies new copies of karbytes_23february2024_journal onto blank M_DISCs (and a total of three sets of three blank M_DISCs are scheduled to be delivered to an Amazon locker (within one month of now) which is local to karbytes at the time and place this plain-text note was originally created).

karbytes plans on storing three copies of karbytes_23february2024_core and three copies of karbytes_23february2024_journal in a fireproof compact disc case which karbytes intends to store in the same metal box as what is described as storing a white binder containing what karbytes deems to be "most essential" karbytes intellectual property (as described by the web page named karbytes_physical_inventory_for_23february2024 in the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) no later than 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_APRIL_2024.

Between 8:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 19_FEBRUARY_2024 and 11:00PM Pacific Standard Time on19_FEBRUARY_2024, karbytes noticed that there were some missing files and incorrectly alphabetically ordered source code files (including HyperText Markup Language files (green)) and media (including plain-text files (orange)) on the web page named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_8 on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (for the version of that web page which was most recently updated on 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 16_FEBRUARY_2024). 

Due to the fact that karbytes already burned one M_DISC copy of the 16_FEBRUARY_2024 version of karbytes_23february2024_core and one M_DISC copy of the 16_FEBRUARY_2024 version of karbytes_23february2024_journals between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 14_FEBRUARY_2024 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 17_FEBRUARY_2024, karbytes plans on destroying and discarding those M_DISCs after the newer up-to-date versions of those karbytes data collections are burned to M_DISCs (as described earlier in this note).
