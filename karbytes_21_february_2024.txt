In the previous plain-text journal entry (i.e. karbytes_21_february_2024.txt in the public karbytes-created GitHub repository named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_8), there is one "mistake" which I am attempting to ammend in this plain-text journal entry: the fact that the number of zip files and data size for karbytes_23february2024_core and/or karbytes_23february2024_journals have increased (to accomodate some GitHub repository file uploads which I made to the aforementioned public karbytes-created GitHub repository between 8:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_FEBRUARY_2024 and 3:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 21_FEBRUARY_2024).

The web pages at the following Uniform Resource Locators have been updated during the aforementioned time interval in accordance with those specified changes to karbytes intellectual property:
