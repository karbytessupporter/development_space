To Whom It May Concern:

karbytes is in the process of burning three M_DISCs which each have the same data contents burned to them.

Those data contents consist exclusively of all of the zip files which are enumerated on the following web page:

https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_16/

A single unwritten 25 gigabyte M_DISC has a data storage capacity sufficient to store all of karbytes (up to the point in time in which the “micro directory” named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_23 of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com named is determined by karbytes to be finalized (i.e. closed to further changes)).

Each of the three aforementioned M_DISCs will be named karbytes2024_0. A single folder containing exclusively 112 unique (i.e. non-duplicate) zip files will also be named karbytes2024_0 (and that folder is what will be burned to each of those three M_DISCs).

Sincerely,
karbytes
