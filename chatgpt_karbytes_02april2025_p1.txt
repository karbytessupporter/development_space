The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o which took place on 01_APRIL_2025 between the hours of 10:00AM Pacific Standard Time and 3:00PM Pacific Standard Time. The conversation pertains to karbytes inquiring ChatGPT about maximum file size per upload commit to a GitHub repository (which entails karbytes learning that there are different maximum upload sizes (per commit) depending on the interface which is used (e.g. local command line terminal interfacing with the GitHub server, the graphical user interface via a web browser)).

(Note that karbytes used the dictation feature which is part of the mobile ChatGPT (Android) app to translate karbytes' spoken words to text (and while that feature still enabled users to review and edit their dictated words before submitting them to ChatGPT)).

karbytes:

Is there a limit to how many repositories or files a user can add to their GitHub account?

ChatGPT:

GitHub allows personal accounts to own an unlimited number of both public and private repositories. However, there is an upper limit: organizations and accounts may not exceed 100,000 repositories. When an account surpasses 50,000 repositories, a banner will appear, noting the approaching limit. 

Regarding file sizes within repositories, GitHub imposes specific limits:

- File Size Limits: Files larger than 50 MB will trigger a warning upon upload. Files exceeding 100 MB are blocked from being added to the repository. 

- Repository Size Recommendations: While there's no strict cap, it's recommended to keep repositories under 1 GB, with a strong recommendation to stay below 5 GB. Exceeding these sizes may impact performance and could prompt GitHub to reach out for corrective action. 

For managing larger files, GitHub offers Git Large File Storage (Git LFS), which handles large files by storing references in the repository while keeping the actual file data in a separate location. This approach helps maintain repository performance and manage storage effectively.

karbytes:

I was not able to upload a file larger than 25 gigabytes (but smaller than 30 gigabytes) to a GitHub repository.

ChatGPT:

Uploading a file larger than 25 gigabytes to a GitHub repository exceeds the platform's storage capabilities. While GitHub's standard interface restricts files over 100 megabytes, Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) extends this limit to accommodate larger files. However, Git LFS itself has maximum file size constraints based on the account type:

- GitHub Free & Pro: Maximum file size of 2 GB.

- GitHub Team: Maximum file size of 4 GB.

- GitHub Enterprise Cloud: Maximum file size of 5 GB.

Attempting to upload files larger than these limits, such as your 25 GB file, will result in upload failures. Additionally, GitHub imposes a 2 GB limit for a single push operation, which can further complicate uploading large files. 

For distributing large files, consider alternative methods such as creating releases on GitHub, which allow individual files up to 2 GB. However, for files exceeding this size, it's advisable to use external storage solutions or file-sharing services, providing links within your repository to these resources.

karbytes:

Sorry, I meant megabytes when I said gigabytes.

ChatGPT:

Thanks for the clarification! If your file was between 25 MB and 30 MB, then the issue likely wasn't due to exceeding GitHubâ€™s hard file size limits, since:

- Files under 50 MB: Uploads should work normally with no warnings.

- Files between 50 MB and 100 MB: Youâ€™ll get a warning when pushing with Git, but it will still succeed.

- Files over 100 MB: GitHub blocks them entirely (youâ€™ll get an error if you try to push such files).

Since your file was under 50 MB, it should have uploaded fine unless:

- You're using the web interface, which might be hitting browser-based timeouts or connection issues.

- You have Git LFS set up incorrectly, which can cause uploads to fail.

- Thereâ€™s a repo or branch protection rule, or storage quota issues on a private repo (e.g., LFS bandwidth limits).

- Your internet connection dropped during the upload.

Let me know if you want to troubleshoot the specific scenario (e.g., which upload method you used, and what the error said).

karbytes:

I was using the web interface instead of command line.

ChatGPT:

Got it â€” when using the GitHub web interface, thereâ€™s a much lower limit for file uploads:

- Maximum file size via web upload: 25 MB

This limit is strict â€” even though GitHub allows larger files via command line (up to 100 MB for regular Git, and more via Git LFS), the web uploader wonâ€™t let you upload files over 25 MB.

To upload files between 25 MB and 100 MB, here are your best options:

- Use Git command line:

[preformatted text]

git add your_large_file.zip
git commit -m "Add large file"
git push origin main

Use Git Large File Storage (LFS) for anything approaching or exceeding 100 MB:

[preformatted text]

git lfs install
git lfs track "*.zip"
git add .gitattributes
git add your_large_file.zip
git commit -m "Track and add large file"
git push origin main

Want help with setting that up step-by-step on your system?

karbytes:

What you provided thus far in this conversation is sufficient for my purposes. Thanks! :)

ChatGPT:

You're very welcome! ðŸ˜Š I'm glad the info helped. If you ever run into more GitHub quirks or want to streamline your workflow, just let me know. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ§
