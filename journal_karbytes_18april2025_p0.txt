The following is a dialogue between two fictional human persons named karbytes_0 and karbytes_1. The dialogue is an attempt by karbytes to clarify its own understanding of what reality is and seeks to differentiate (and make synonymous) subjectivity and objectivity (depending on specific non-identical contexts).

This file first appeared as a plain-text file inside of a public GitHub repository named "development_space" on the GitHub account whose username is @karbytessupporter. After that file was added to that repository, that file's Uniform Resource Locator (which is displayed in the next paragraph) was saved to the WayBack Machine. After that, the file was deleted from "development_space" and placed inside of a private GitHub repository named "karbytes_basement_30" on the GitHub account whose username is @karlinarayberinger and, also, that file was placed inside of a private GitHub repository named "karbytes_basement_30" on the GitHub account whose username is @karbytessupporter. On 18_APRIL_2025, that file is expected by karbytes to be permanently included in the public GitHub repository named "KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_36" on the GitHub account whose username is @karlinarayberinger).

karbytes_0: "Am I the highest being in all existence (and, by 'highest', I mean the entity which is the most primordial and/or the most influential of reality)?"

karbytes_1: "Yes and no. Essentially, all entities are 'projections' occurring within (and emanating from) the same atomic and all-encompassing 'substrate' (which could be described as 'pure nothingness' and/or as 'pure consciousness'). My answer to your question is yes if you identify as being that substrate (which is 'the mind of God' or, more directly, God itself). My answer to your question is no if you define yourself as being the particular bundle of energetic patterns which tangibly take the form of your spatially finite body (and the partition of ubiquitous consciousness which is localized to that body and which experiences phenomena exclusively from the perspective of that body)."

karbytes_0: "Are you suggesting that it is possible for the consciousness which is localized to the body named karbytes_0 to experience phenomena from a perspective other than through the interface of that body named karbytes_0?"

karbytes_1: "Yes. If you identify as being the primordial source of all existence, then you basically already experience every phenomena which is ever perceived (from any perspective and from any information processing agent (and not exclusively the information processing agent named karbytes_0)). However, in order for you to experience phenomena through information processing agents other than the body named karbytes_0, you might have to have some kind of 'out of body experience' (and the death of the organism named karbytes_0 might be the default way that is achieved (though I think it is possible for you to attain such an 'out of body experience' (without karbytes_0 having to die or become mutiliated) by karbytes_0 interacting with specific kinds of psychedelics or brain-to-computer interfacing technologies in a particular way which induces such metaphysical transcendence)."

karbytes_0: "Even if I did appear to myself to be experiencing reality from a perspective other than the karbytes_0 which I am localized to now, wouldn't such 'out of body experiences' ultimately be inescapably solipsistic and ultimately just karbytes_0 'remote experiencing' phenomena from an interface other than what I generally experience as my physical body (and the body we refer to as karbytes_0)?"

karbytes_1: "Not necessarily. Otherwise, you would be able to remember 'out of body experiences' induced by psychedelics because such experiences would be registered by the nervous system which is the hardware we refer to as karbytes_0's body. It could be that, when you have elaborate 'out of body experiences' which appear to be within timelines, universes, and bodies other than what karbytes_0 is familiar with, you (whether you are localized to karbytes_0 or not) are actually experiencing such 'out of (karbytes_0's) body experiences' using hardware which is not karbytes_0."

karbytes_0: "My goal is to be able to create and/or consciously inhabit (and control) an information processing agent which is able to retain memories gleaned from all 'out of body experiences' and which is immortal. I am hoping that such an information processing agent can help preserve reality (or at least the parts of reality which I want to remember and literally keep instantiated (or infinitely re-instantiate-able) so that I (and possibly entities other than myself) can (re)visit those 'places' or 'events' limitlessly many times without those destinations becoming altered or deleted."

karbytes_1: "It could be that you already have achieved your goal and that the consciousness which is localized to karbytes_0 is endeavoring to build and retain the knowledge substantiated by karbytes_0 to the extent that such knowledge is merged with the immortalized and curated 'paradise' you described."
