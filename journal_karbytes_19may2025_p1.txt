For the duration of this hiatus (from updating karbytes), I decided to not showcase any of the files which are placed in the private (@karlinarayberinger anf @karbytessupporter) karbytes_basement_36 GitHub repositories also in the public (@karbytessupporter) development_space GitHub repository.

Between 11:11PM Pacific Standard Time on 19_MAY_2025 and 11:11AM Pacific Standard Time on 20_MAY_2025, I plan on burning at least one M_DISC with exactly one folder named karbytes19may2025_beta which contains exactly two sub-folders: karbytes2025_12 (the official current version of karbytes at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 18_MAY_2025) and karbytes_basement_36_19may2025 (the entire contents of the aforementioned private GitHub repository which is named karbytes_basement_36).

(Note that (@karlinarayberinger) karbytes_basement_36 and (@karbytessupporter) karbytes_basement_36 are intended to contain the same files and hence generate identical zip files when downloaded from GitHub dot Com).

My plan for when this hiatus ends is to incorporate all the files which are in karbytes_basement_36 into the next chapter of karbytes (and that next chapter will be named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40).
