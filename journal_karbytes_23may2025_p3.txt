Within the past seven days, a group of teenage or young adult boys in a car showed up several times in the parking lot where I was sitting in my car after finishing a hike at Las Trampas Wilderness screaming at me that they would strip my car and driving in fast circles around the parking lot and, at times, making it seem like they were going to side sweep my car or even drive headfirst into the driver side door where I was sitting. I thought they were threatening to cause me bodily injury or property damage because they thought I had no right to be in "their" territory. Within the past two hours I noticed that at least one of the tires on my car was punctured to the extent that it needs to be replaced. When I filled that tire with air and screwed the cap back on, air was gushing out of the hole in the tire which was approximately two centimeters wide (which might have been a puncture from a knife or piece of glass). I hope that someone didn't deliberately puncture that tire, but I have ample reason to suspect that I am the target of ongoing "hate crimes" from people who want to sabotage karbytes' livelihood. I don't like making reports like this because it gives thugs the publicity they seek and the schadenfreude they crave. I wrote this note, however, to document what I think is a likely example of gang stalking and property vandalism from people opposed to my self-sovereignty and personal culture. It seems that, in their minds, only their culture and freedom should be protected and respected; outsiders be damned!
