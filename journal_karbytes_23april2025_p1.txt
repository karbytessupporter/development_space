karbytes_1: "Elaborate."

karbytes_0: "I prefer to be unconditionally in a place that I think of as a heaven which includes knowledge of any and all phenomena I consider to be what I would not want to experience (and that 'heaven' would be available to all sentient beings and ideally the only experience-able reality)."
