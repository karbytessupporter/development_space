Excellent! I will be using that in a new web page of karbytes which I am working on now which is a rather uncensored distillation of some of my recent thoughts. Thanks!

You're very welcome! I'm glad it fits the tone and purpose of your new karbytes page. Feel free to reach out if you'd like help crafting the accompanying text or designing the layout. Looking forward to seeing how it turns out.
