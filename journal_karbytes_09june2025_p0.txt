I decided to try saving as much money as is feasible for me to do in my Patelco checking account and then keeping the rest of my money available to immediately spend in my business PayPal account (which is connected to a PayPal debit card that I can only get replacements of via snail mail (whereas the Patelco debit card can be replaced by walking into a Patelco branch, presenting a valid form of identication, and requesting a free replacement Patelco debit card (which typically happened for me within the span of 20 minutes of walking into the Patelco branch even without a scheduled appointment))). I tend to keep my PayPal debit card and my latest driver's license card on my person at all times while I tend to keep my Patelco debit card (and one of my older driver's license) securely stowed away in a box in my room at my legal address so that I have those as backup in the event that I lose my on-person cards. I am trying to build up a modest savings at a comfortable pace in my Patelco account so that I can immediately replace essential components of my setup such as laptop computers, phones, shoes, and other equipment which enables me to continuously enjoy the lifestyle which karbytes was forged through (and which is also infrastructural support to (karbytes)).
