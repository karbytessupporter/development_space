To Whom It May Concern:

karbytes is in the process of burning three M_DISCs which each have the same data contents burned to them.

Those data contents consist of, at minimum, all of the zip files which are enumerated on the following web page in the folder named mdisc_karbytes2025_0 (i.e. disc 1 of 1):

https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_0/

A single unwritten 25 gigabyte M_DISC has a data storage capacity sufficient to store all of karbytes (up to the point in time in which the “micro directory” named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_27 of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com named is determined by karbytes to be finalized (i.e. closed to further changes)).

Sincerely,
karbytes
