If I need to be in a particular mood or setting to write or think about a particular topic, then I consider that topic to be more "purple" than "green" (in general). 

If my mood does not seem to significantly affect my ability to write or think about a particular topic, then I consider that topic to be more "green" than "purple" (in general).

The terms "green" and "purple" (in the context of this journal entry) are preliminarily defined in the following older journal entry:

Newer Definitions of "green" and "purple" (with respect to karbytes):

The category "green" refers to a file within karbytes which karbytes has decided does not require a special type of mental state (other than non-impared mental functioning) to create nor to appreciate (during that file's creation or after that file's creation).

The category "purple" refers to a file within karbytes which karbytes typically needs to be in a relatively abnormal mental state to create and to feel compelled to review.
