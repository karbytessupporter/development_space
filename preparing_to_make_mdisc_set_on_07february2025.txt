To Whom It May Concern:

karbytes is in the process(*) of burning three M_DISCs which each have the same data contents burned to them.

Those data contents consist of, at minimum, all of the zip files which are enumerated on the following web page in the folder named mdisc_karbytes2025_5 (i.e. disc 1 of 1):

https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_5/

A single unwritten 25 gigabyte M_DISC has a data storage capacity sufficient to store all of karbytes (up to the point in time in which the “micro directory” named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_31 of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com named is determined by karbytes to be finalized (i.e. closed to further changes)).

Sincerely,
karbytes

(*) The aforementioned process (of burning three M_DISCs which each contain the entire contents of karbytes (as that data collection is configured at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on the last day in which the aforementioned “micro directory” and accompanying GitHub repository is closed to further changes)) is expected to take no longer than three months to complete (starting at the time this web page was first published (and the day this web page was first published is 07_FEBRUARY_2025)).
