To Whom It May Concern:

My latest ongoing "thought experiment" basically amounts to me "secretly" (unless someone asks me about it or if I think it seems necessary for me to disclose within a specific context) thinking and behaving as though the following hypothesis is true: all phenomena take place inside of a single mind (including the existence of multiple simultaneously occurring sub-minds such as individual human beings). A major implication of such a hypothetical reality configuration is that there could be sub-minds which can teleport from one piece of matter (which is ultimately simulated qualia due to the fact that all matter in such an all-encompassing context is generated from within that all-encompassing mind) to some other piece of matter. What I mean to imply is that apparently discrete and non-overlapping information processing agents could possibly be composites made of multiple discrete information processing agents and that any continuity of consciousness or of ability to recall specific and relatively unchanging memory structures is preserved by teleporting pieces of an agent's constituent hardware and software (both of which I presume are ultimately reducible to software (comprised of "bits" of information expressed as atomically small packets of energy)) from one frame of reference to another.

Why this seems pragmatic to me is that engaging in such a game of imagining that what I said in the previous paragraph is true is that it is ultimately futile and factually incorrect for me to assert that karbytes is entirely self-contained. That helps to lessen my anxiety about the death or dissolution of my apparently non-fungible human body (and uniquely corresponding mind and sense of self) given that I imagine that parts of me are sometimes replaced whether I am immediately aware of that exchange or not. Such an imagination game makes me feel less needy to psychologically project some kind of sacred boundary around my body (and mind) to block out what I call pathogens or thieves of "my" resources (which really "belong to" the environment). I think that, if and when any sub-mind dies, it does become reincarnated with varying degrees of having retained memories or identity traits from prior incarnations. I think there may be highly intelligent beings "behind the scenes" and that it may be possible for me to collaborate with them in achieving my goals (which include making it such that karbytes logically proves and/or enables itself to become an immortal mind which also has with it (and in it) a codex comprised of the digital files I amass into a singular entity and refer to as karbytes on my blog that functions as a home for my mind to continuously return to after exploring karbytes-approved partitions of whatever is possible for nature to conjure up). Such a codex would serve as a kernel of core memories and identity features which I choose to retain so that I can effectively stay instantiated as the real karbytes even if some of my lower-priority memories disintegrate over time (because the process of learning seems to require routine pruning of synaptic connections which are not apparently necessary beyond a specific period of time in my (ideally infinitely long) evolutionary timeline). That might result in me apparently revisiting the same circuit of nodes and edges along the graph which is my traversal through what is possible for nature to imagine and possibly not remembering how many times I traverse a particular circuit (which is okay with me provided that I am genuinely enjoying that process and apparently always encountering new and delightful qualia and achievements to behold).

I do not mean for such fanciful thought indulgences to undermine the severity of human suffering and "real world" problems (even if all that human stuff is entirely imaginary and merely within a dream). That's why I will try not to bring this metaphysical idealizations up unless the context to mention them seems appropriate and useful to me (and to the humans who are not karbytes (so that they do not get upset and try to impede my making progress towards my goals)). I do not mean to imply that I am the only person with such ideas, opportunities, and capabilities. Instead, I hope to convey (in a non-coercive manner) that any and all persons are ultimately each a particular facet of the same all-encompassing and singular mind. I want to posit a potentially indestructible source of unlimited creative and sentient power: the absolute and irreducible substrate of pure nothingness (which is logically inside of every phenomenal (and noumenal) structure and also the generative source of every phenomenon and noumenon).

In summary, my "ideology" boils down to the premise that every something inevitably arises out of pure nothingness (and that pure nothingness is everywhere and synonymous with what I already referred to as a singular all-encompassing mind). I would like to posit (even though what I say is not "definitively" backed by empirical evidence) that any instance of consciousness is that pure nothingness underlying some particular subjective frame of reference (and that such consciousness is unconditionally present).

Sincerely,
