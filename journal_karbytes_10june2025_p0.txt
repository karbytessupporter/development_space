Up until now in my continous usage of intramuscular testosterone injections, I decided to experiment with giving myself a 0.9 milliliter dose instead of the usual 0.8 milliliter dose of testosterone cypianate (which I have been doing once every 14 days since late 2022). Within the past 24 hours I gave myself that 0.9 milliliter injection and have notice subtle effects which contrast with how I felt yesterday (when I was relatively low on testosterone). Here is what I noticed...

While "high" on testosterone, I feel:

- Bigger sense of self-importance and "ego"

- Dulled sense of physical pain and wariness to physical danger

- Increased sense of being anger-prone and ready to act assertive with my physical presence

While "low" on testosterone, I feel:

- Not as easily offended in the ego; not as self-defensive

- Not as energetic and not as eager to physically exercise strenuously

- Not as "urgent" about accomplishing my goals; more tolerant of being held back

Which testosterone level I prefer to experience:

Being relatively "high" in testosterone is what I prefer. What that does not imply is that I am eager to fight with people. I hate how humans who are relatively "high" in testerone oftentimes seem to be immature in their "wielding" of it (particularly by using it as a means to oppress, terrorize, and harm people other than themselves and the ecosystem at large). I hope to be a good example of how to properly "wield" testosterone; providing an example of how it can be used to make one more resolute in upholding their ethical priciples and brave in their pursuit of worthwhile goals.

This is not meant to denigrate those who are relatively "low" in testosterone and/or relatively "high" in estrogen. I understand (both from firsthand experience having "over-dosed" for approximately five consecutive years on estrogen in the form of hormonal birth control pills and from learning about people other than myself who are either naturally estrogen-dominant (instead of testosterone-dominant) or who make themselves estrogen-dominant through artificial means (such as in the case of male-to-female transsexuals)) that estrogen-dominance is a valid mode of human experience which is not inherently inferior to testosterone-dominance. It really depends on what one's goals, preferences, and personality are. Not everyone has the same priorities and inclinations. I want each person to be able to decide for itself what it wants to do with its own body and have the freedom to do that (provided that what they do does not involve violating other people's basic human rights).

What are basic human rights?

In a nutshell, I would say that most basic human right is the ethical precept which says, "Each person is unconditionally entitled to not be subject to any more suffering than what is deemed necessary to benefit human civilization as a whole." An implication of what I said is that no person "should" ever be subject to tortuous or dangerous situations unless that person voluntarily consents to such circumstances. Other than that (and following from that first precept), I would say that any human is always entitled to do whatever it wants to.
