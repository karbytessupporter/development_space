<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">Is hitting a woman (or girl) ever justified?</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">I would say that hitting a female human is no more nor more less justified than hitting any other object.</span> I say that given that I am currently attempting to represent a perspective which is ultimately amoral and entirely naturalistic (rather than mystical, supernatural, or constrained to a particular culture or ideological framework).</p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">My reason for writing this is that, based on my own personal experience, women oftentimes seem to take advantage of the fact that society generally makes if morally unacceptable to physically assault a woman and even to say (or even think) things about a woman which is unflattering to her (unless her behavior or thoughts seem to deviate too sharply from what society enshrines as normal and even necessary feminity (exclusively for biologically female humans).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">I think that treating female humans as though they are (a) more innocent than their male human counterparts and (b) physically and/or mentally weaker than their male counterparts reinforces the stereotype of female humans being physically and mentally weaker than their male human counterparts. I prefer to treat all human beings as, more or less, being almost identical in their degree of agency (which means it is ultimately up to them when it comes to how fit they are physically and mentally (at least in societies where the legal systems and economies regard men and women as fundamentally interchangeable (with reproductive organs and their capacities being the only major difference accounted for))). If women don't like being physically weak, they can recognize and address their gender dysphoria by getting a prescription for testosterone and work on building up their physical and mental fitness so that they can honestly compete on the same "playing field" as their biolocical male counterparts without implicitly requiring being treated as relatively handicapped. Even if a person in such a society has a major physiologically-based "disability" which makes them effectively handicapped (i.e. requiring "special treatment" relative to so-called "able bodied" persons), such a person, if genuinely interested in living in accordance to karbytes' primary values, should strive to maximize their autonomy and minimize the degree to which they are a burden to themselves and to other persons.</span></p>
<p>(Earlier I said I was attempting to represent an objective and amoral perspective. At this point in this journal entry, I acknowlege that I lied and am instead taking the position of a particular egotist whose self-assigned name is karbytes. As an egotist, I have an agenda to fulfill my self-serving <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_primary_values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goals</a>. That's not amorality. Instead, that is a type of morality; a type of operating within the bounds of preferences and preference-informed, goal-oriented behavior as an information processing agent interacting with and within a larger encompassing environment).</p>
<p>As a <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_ontology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compatibilist</a> (and not a hard determinist), I assume the position of someone who believes that free will can exist as a virtual or illusory construct comprised of simpler and more obviously deterministic physical processes. I therefore believe that the free will (of a particular information processing agent) is entirely dependent on that information processing agent's respective environment and that such free will can be depleted if that information processing agent loses too much of its internal energy before it replenishes its internal energy. <span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">Hence, if a woman attempts to use her assumed social advantage of being relatively untouchable because she is a woman to antagonize me beyond my capacity to tolerate her aggravating antics, I think it is justifiable that I retaliate in a way which may take the form of physical violence or some other form of punitive behavior agaisnt her as a means to protect myself from being made to feel that I am violating my own sense of egotistic ethics so much that I am on the brink of wanting to commit suicide. I would rather end her than me. That's just how I choose to program myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">I really do not care whether my tormentor is a male or female or of any other demographic. Even if it looks and acts like my clone I would prioritize my own comfort and survival over that clone's.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">The "moral" of the story is try not to push information processing agents' to their breaking points (where they are "forced" to act out in ways which cause suffering or which spur on cycles of violence, warfare, and diminished quality of life for any sentient being).</span></p>
<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff0000">I hope you understand and agree with what I said in this note.</strong></p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
karbtes</p>
