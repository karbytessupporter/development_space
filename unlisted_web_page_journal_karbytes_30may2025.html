<p>I used Google Maps to calculate that my walking time from Walnut Creek BART station to Rossmoor Labyrinth (which I consider to be part of Las Trampas Wilderness because I walked from Las Trampas Staging Area on Bollinger Canyon Road to Roosmoor Labyrinth via the wilderness trail system several times already) is approximately two hours in one direction. As my 13_JUNE_2025 court date approaches (where I will find out whether or not the judicial system has decided to clear the misdemeanors from my criminal background checks), my main job seems to be setting myself up to have a nice lifestyle without a car (and while using mostly BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) trains and walking to commute) especially with knowledge and means to comfortably and safely hike and camp in the wilderness near or within Las Trampas Wilderness (which is my current all-time favorite wilderness area). My "default" plan is to wait until Amazon warehouses start offering seasonal employment positions at warehouses which are within my means to commute to (using BART and walking) assuming that my criminal record is cleared. Otherwise, I'll look elsewhere for warehouse employment within the same time period (which is within the next two years). I'll just keep science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) activities as a hobby to keep my mind and spirit sharp rather than planned on means of employment (for now). <span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">The humans are insidiously greedy, selfish, and destructive to my preferred way of life (in general). I hence try to minimize how much I commune with them (because I think they simply want to make me subordinate to them and/or to assimilate to their ways of life instead of mine). It's an ongoing power struggle with brain rot chauvinists (who only seem to be exploding in number and ecological impact). Perhaps I'll try walking thar entire length tonight. More likely, I'd drive to scope out the route before walking it.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">I hear a lot of ignorant entitled brats yelling and talking in an arrogant and obnoxious manner. Maybe my memory is fuzzy, but I don't recall people acting that bratty when I was that age. It seems like the current set of adolescents is extremely rude, intellectually stunted, and shallow compared to mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">A sad truth about why so many of my journal entries and ChatGPT transcripts as of late are relegated to private repositories is that those belligerent entitled brats are trying to infiltrate my writings and activities like the greedy genocidal parasites they are. They are literally a toxic influence to me and they seem vehemently closed off to any new information. They seem to be zealots for never leaving their comfort zones. This writing may be a refreshing read for me later in life. I doubt I'll lower my public Internet platform by sharing this note there.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">The brat boys drive obnoxiously loud gas guzzlers and blast their dumb dumb "music". The girls moan and cackle hysterically like brainless drunkards whose only worth is limited to the male gaze. It's a disgusting phenomenon to behold. I seem to be the only person I know who openly talks about it and who does not merely play along (as though broccoli head is the only class that matters).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">Lastly, if and when it is time for a job at Amazon warehouse, I'll most likely wear a COVID-19 mask just to prevent vicious apes from scrutinizing my mouth shape.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">Some guy keeps revving his engine multiple times as though screaming, "Hey! Hey! Notice MEEEEE!!!" It's disgusting how so many women act like dumbed down docile cows for him to wrangle and render subordinate sell-outs to the patriarchy.</span></p>

<p>Just for fun (and as potential future "legacy" karbytes content to release at least two months from now) I can make HTML only versions of the plain-text notes I have amassed thus far in the private GitHub repositories named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytessupporter.blogspot.com/2025/06/karbytesbasement37waybackmachinefilesav.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes_basement_37</a> such that the "icky" or "sensitive" parts are "redacted" using span HTML tags which set the background and text color to each be black so that one must view the web page source code to see the un-redacted version of that web page (which I think most casual users of the Internet at this time are not likely going to attempt doing).</p>
