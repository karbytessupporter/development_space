Is there no Amazon in Norway?

ChatGPT:

Amazon does not have a dedicated website or fulfillment center in Norway. However, residents can order products from various international Amazon sites, such as Amazon UK, Germany, and the US. While these platforms offer a wide range of products, not all items are eligible for shipping to Norway, and delivery times can be longer compared to domestic shipping. Additionally, orders may be subject to import duties and taxes, which can increase the overall cost. For example, goods priced over NOK 350 are typically subject to Norwegian VAT and processing fees. 

Some users have reported that Amazon Germany (amazon.de) offers relatively better shipping options to Norway, with VAT included at checkout, potentially reducing unexpected costs upon delivery. 

It's advisable to check product availability and shipping policies on the specific Amazon site you intend to use, as they can vary. Be mindful of potential additional costs, such as import duties and taxes, when ordering from international retailers.

Describe the purpose and reality of Trump's current presidential policy implementations.

ChatGPT:

As of April 2025, President Donald Trump’s second term has been marked by a series of aggressive and transformative policy implementations across various sectors. Below is an overview of key initiatives and their current realities:

1. Immigration and Border Enforcement

President Trump has reinstated several hardline immigration policies:

- Border Measures: Resumed construction of the border wall, reinstated the "Remain in Mexico" policy, and disabled the CBP One app used for scheduling border crossings. 

- Deportation Efforts: Set ambitious targets for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to conduct 1,200 to 1,500 daily arrests. However, actual arrest numbers have lagged behind these goals. 

- Legal Challenges: Efforts to end birthright citizenship and suspend the Refugee Admissions Program have faced legal obstacles. 

2. Trade and Economic Policy

The administration has pursued protectionist economic strategies:

- Tariffs: Imposed sweeping tariffs, including a 10% baseline on all imports and up to 145% on Chinese goods, aiming to reduce trade deficits and encourage domestic manufacturing. 

- Market Impact: These tariffs have led to significant market volatility, with critics warning of potential economic downturns. 

- Tax and Spending: Plans to fund tax cuts through tariff revenues and budget reductions are underway, though their long-term efficacy remains debated. 

3. Energy and Climate Policy

Energy policies have shifted focus:

- Fossil Fuels: Signed executive orders to boost coal production by easing environmental regulations and extending the operation of aging coal plants. 
    
- Climate Agreements: Withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, emphasizing national sovereignty over international environmental commitments. 

- Clean Energy: Tariffs on imported clean energy components have raised concerns about hindering the transition to renewable energy sources. 

4. Civil Rights and Social Policy

Significant changes have been made to civil rights policies:

- Commission Leadership: Attempted to replace the chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, signaling a shift in focus towards issues like non-citizen voting and reverse discrimination. 
  
- Gender Definitions: Issued an executive order defining sex strictly as male or female, impacting federal policies on gender identity and rolling back protections for transgender individuals. 

5. Government Restructuring and Workforce

Efforts to reshape the federal government include:

- Hiring Freeze: Implemented a federal hiring freeze, with exceptions for certain positions, aiming to reduce the size of the federal workforce. 

- Agency Reforms: Established the Department of Government Efficiency to oversee mass layoffs and structural changes within federal agencies. 

6. Foreign Policy and International Relations

Foreign policy has taken a more unilateral approach:

- International Organizations: Ceased funding and cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO). 

- Diplomatic Relations: Adopted a transactional stance with allies, leading to strained relationships and a reevaluation of international commitments. 

These policy implementations reflect President Trump's commitment to his "America First" agenda, emphasizing national sovereignty, economic protectionism, and a reduction in federal oversight. However, they have also sparked significant debate and legal challenges, with critics expressing concerns over their long-term implications for domestic and international affairs.​

How many people in the United States starve to death due to lack of funds?

ChatGPT:

In the United States, deaths directly attributed to starvation are exceedingly rare. Estimates suggest that approximately 20 to 30 people die from starvation annually, often in cases involving severe neglect, mental illness, or extreme isolation. 

However, malnutrition-related deaths are more prevalent, particularly among older adults. Between 1999 and 2020, over 93,000 individuals aged 65 and older died from malnutrition. The age-adjusted mortality rate for this group rose from 10.7 per 100,000 in 1999 to 25.0 per 100,000 in 2020. 

Food insecurity, defined as limited or uncertain access to adequate food, affects a significant portion of the U.S. population. In 2023, 13.5% of U.S. households—approximately 18 million—experienced food insecurity at some point during the year. This issue disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and low-income families.

While starvation deaths are uncommon, the broader challenges of malnutrition and food insecurity remain pressing public health concerns in the United States.

Three Days in the Life of a Food-Insecure American

Day 1: Monday – Running on Empty

I wake up with a hollow feeling in my stomach. It's Monday morning and I have no breakfast to speak of – just tap water and maybe a half-cup of yesterday’s coffee reheated. I skip breakfast entirely, not by choice but by necessity. Sadly, I’m far from alone in this; I remember reading that about 1 in 7 people in the United States struggle with food insecurity. It’s a sobering thought as I head out the door, stomach already growling, to start my day.

At work, the hunger follows me. I’m an hourly retail associate at a big store, on my feet all day. By lunchtime, I’m lightheaded and find it hard to focus on helping customers. I skip lunch as well – I didn’t bring anything from home, and I can’t afford to buy a meal. (I only had a few dollars until payday, and those went to bus fare and paying part of the electric bill.) My hands tremble a bit as I restock shelves, and I feel a pang of embarrassment when a coworker notices my fatigue. I just claim I’m tired, rather than admit the truth: I haven’t eaten at all today. In households facing very low food security, it’s common to cut portions or skip meals – in fact, over one-third reported having days with no food at all. Knowing this fact doesn’t make the hunger easier, but it reminds me that my situation is part of a bigger problem.

The afternoon drags on. I find myself getting irritable (the classic “hangry” mood). A customer’s minor complaint almost brings me to tears because I’m exhausted and anxious. Food insecurity brings a lot of stress and anxiety – I’ve heard that it’s strongly linked to depression and worry, and I can feel why. It’s hard to smile or think positively when you’re running on empty. Still, I push through my shift by chewing gum and drinking water to dull the hunger pangs.

Dinner is meager but I manage something. I have a single packet of instant ramen noodles at home, plus a few wilted spinach leaves I salvaged from last week’s groceries. I boil the noodles and stir in the spinach. It’s not much nutrition, mostly salt and carbs, but it quiets my stomach for the night. I debate how to stretch my remaining food – there’s one can of green beans in the cupboard and a bit of rice. I decide to save those for tomorrow. After eating, I finally feel a little relief physically, but my mind is still racing. I worry about tomorrow’s meals already. Lying in bed, I scroll my phone and see upbeat social media posts from friends about fancy dinners or new recipes. I feel a mix of isolation and shame. Why can’t I get it together? Why is something as basic as dinner a daily battle for me? There are 47 million people in this wealthy country living in food-insecure households– logically I know I’m not a failure, that this is a widespread economic problem, but emotionally I still feel guilt and anxiety. I fall asleep with an aching stomach and the resolve that tomorrow I’ll find a way to get some proper food, even if it means seeking help I’ve avoided.

Day 2: Tuesday – Finding Help and Coping

Morning comes, and I skip breakfast again – just a cup of hot water with a little lemon (free from work break room supplies). Skipping meals has almost become routine for me, though it never gets easier. My body is running on fumes. Today is truck unload day at the store, which means heavy lifting. I’m dreading it because I have so little energy. Somehow, I make it through a few hours, but I can’t stop daydreaming about food. I catch myself imagining a sandwich or a banana. It’s like my brain won’t focus on anything else. Hunger affects my productivity – I move slower, and simple tasks feel more difficult. I recall a statistic from a pamphlet that food insecurity often leads to trouble concentrating at work or school, which makes sense as I experience it firsthand. By mid-shift, I’m counting the hours until I can try to get help. It’s also the 20th of the month, and my SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits are completely used up. (I get a modest amount on the 1st of each month, and like many recipients, I run out long before the month ends – I read that nearly 80% of SNAP benefits are spent in the first two weeks, which certainly matches my experience.)

After work, I head straight to the local food pantry. I’ve been nervous about going; there’s a bit of lingering pride (or maybe fear of stigma) that made me hesitate to seek this help before. But hunger trumps pride today. When I arrive, there’s already a line of people outside the community center. I see all kinds of folks – single moms with toddlers, elderly men and women, even people who look like they might have just come from an office job. Hunger doesn’t discriminate. The volunteers are kind; they check me in with no judgment. Still, I feel a flush of shame when I give my name and address, as if admitting I can’t feed myself is some personal failing. But that feeling eases when one volunteer says quietly, “We’re busy these days – so many people need a little help, you’re not alone.” She’s right. Food banks across the country have seen surging demand and are distributing billions of meals to people in need (over 5.3 billion meals were distributed by U.S. food banks in 2023). I’m one of those people now, just trying to get by.

Caption: Heating up a simple microwavable dinner after visiting the food pantry. Even a small hot meal provides comfort when you’ve been hungry.

Inside the pantry, I receive a bag of groceries: a box of pasta, a few cans of vegetables and soup, a loaf of day-old bread, peanut butter, and even a dozen eggs – a generous haul by my standards. They also give me a couple of frozen microwave dinners donated by a local store. I feel a wave of relief just holding this food. Tonight, I won’t go to bed hungry. When I get home, I immediately heat up one of the frozen dinners (a tray of mac and cheese with mixed veggies) in the microwave. It’s the best meal I’ve had all week simply because it’s hot, filling, and I didn’t have to ration it. After eating, I finally feel full. My mood lifts as the tension in my body releases a bit. The mental strain eases when I know I have food for tomorrow. With the pantry supplies, I plan out a few simple meals: peanut butter sandwiches for lunch, pasta with canned veggies for dinner. These foods are not the healthiest – lots of starch and canned fare – but beggars can’t be choosers. I’m aware of the trade-off between nutrition and cost all the time. Fresh fruits, lean meats – those are luxuries right now. As is common for folks on a tight food budget, I have to prioritize cheap calories over nutrition, relying on processed and packaged foods because they’re affordable and shelf-stable. I wish I could afford fresh salad or fish, but healthy food has become so expensive that I, like many others, compensate by eating cheaper, less healthy items. It’s an unfortunate reality noted in studies and one I live daily.

Still, tonight I go to bed with a grateful heart. The food pantry turned my day around. I even have a little hope – maybe I can get through the rest of the week now. My stomach is comfortably full for the first time in days, which helps me finally relax. Before sleeping, I jot down a budget in my journal: how I’ll use the pantry items and a plan to set aside a few dollars from my next paycheck to buy fresh produce at the discount market. It’s ambitious, but planning makes me feel a bit more in control. Coping mechanisms kick in – I’m trying to stay organized and make the food last. Many people in my situation stretch meals by diluting soups or eating “breakfast for dinner” (like eggs on toast) to save money; I’ll likely do the same. As I drift off, I feel the weight of anxiety lessen just a bit, replaced by a modest optimism that tomorrow can be a better day.

Day 3: Wednesday – Balancing, Hoping, and Moving Forward

This morning, I actually eat breakfast. It’s a small meal – just a piece of toast with peanut butter – but it’s something. Having even a modest breakfast gives me more energy at work. I’m still hungry by mid-morning, but knowing I have a peanut butter sandwich in my bag for lunch keeps me going. At lunch break, I sit in the break room and finally eat openly, instead of hiding the fact that I’m eating nothing. It’s just a sandwich and a bruised apple I got from the pantry, but it tastes amazing to me right now. One of my coworkers heats up a store-bought salad and I catch the scent of fresh greens – I’ll admit, I feel a stab of envy. The cost of a salad from the grocery store salad bar would blow my whole food budget for the day. I shake off the envy and focus on what I have. Emotionally, I’m a bit steadier today with some food in my system. I’m less irritable and more able to do my job without my stomach distracting me. It’s a reminder of how closely the mind and body are connected; when you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, it’s hard to think of anything else. The constant uncertainty about food creates a background noise of stress. In fact, researchers have noted that living with food insecurity often means living with persistent anxiety, sadness, and even depression. I certainly feel that on the bad days. But today is a little better.

After work, I face another common trade-off. My tank is almost on “E” and I need gas to drive to work the rest of the week (on days I can borrow my cousin’s car). I have about $10 left in cash. I debate: do I put this $10 in the gas tank, or use it to buy a gallon of milk and some bananas? If I don’t get gas, I might not make it to work Friday (the buses don’t run early enough for my shift). If I don’t buy any food, I’ll be down to just dry goods from the pantry. This kind of impossible choice between basic needs is something I deal with constantly – and I know many families have to choose between paying the rent or buying groceries, or medicine vs. food. In my case, I decide to spend $7 on gas and $3 on a few bananas. It feels like a small win to get even a little fresh fruit. When you’re food-insecure, financial triage becomes a daily exercise. Often we end up paying for other necessities instead of food, robbing Peter to pay Paul, so to speak, just to scrape by.

Dinner tonight is the pasta I got from the pantry, cooked with a can of tomato soup as sauce. It’s actually tasty after I add some seasoning. I miss having protein, but at least I have carbs to fill me up. I make enough to save a portion for tomorrow’s lunch. As I eat, I reflect on these last few days. It’s been a rollercoaster of hunger and relief, shame and gratitude. Food insecurity is such an emotional ride – one day you’re despairing because you have nothing, the next you feel hope because a kind person or agency helped you out, and then you’re anxious the day after about how long that help will last. I realize I’ve shown a lot of resilience just to keep going like this. Many people in my situation exhibit a quiet resilience; we find ways to cope, whether by visiting food banks, cutting out all non-essentials, or leaning on friends and family when possible. We also have our setbacks, like my day of total hunger on Monday, but we persist.

Before bed, I write in my journal and acknowledge my small victories: I sought help, I have food for tomorrow, I made it through work without collapsing, and I even have a few bananas on the counter for breakfast. Not every day will be this manageable, I know. There will be hard days again – perhaps even this weekend when the pantry supplies run low. But I have a plan to visit a free community meal at a local church on Sunday, and my next SNAP allotment comes in a little over a week. I’m also going to talk to my manager about possibly getting more hours. It’s tough to admit I need more to survive, but many “hardworking community members” facing food insecurity still remain optimistic about the future, and I want to count myself among them. This experience, as difficult as it is, hasn’t taken away my hope. I still dream of a day when I won’t have to worry every morning about food. I want what anyone would want: dignity, a healthy meal, and the peace of mind that tomorrow will be okay.

As I turn out the light, my stomach is not full, but it’s not painfully empty either. And my mind is a little more at ease. Three days in my life have passed, each with its challenges and small mercies. This is the reality for me and millions of others – a constant balancing act between hunger and hope. I face tomorrow with cautious optimism, determined to survive and someday, hopefully, to thrive. In the meantime, I take it one day at a time, grateful for any meal I can get and for the strength to keep pushing forward. No one should have to live this way, and I hold onto the belief that better days will come, for me and for everyone struggling with hunger. Until then, I’ll do what I’ve been doing: carry on the best I can, finding support where it’s available, and never losing hope that the future can be brighter.

Sources: The experiences and challenges described are consistent with those reported by millions of food-insecure Americans. For instance, many households reduce meal size or skip meals when food is scarce, and food insecurity affects an estimated 47 million people in the U.S., about 1 in 7 residents. Individuals facing food insecurity often turn to food banks; in 2023, food banks nationwide distributed over 5.3 billion meals to meet rising demand. Unfortunately, cost considerations force many to prioritize cheap, calorie-dense foods over nutritious options, and the stress of uncertainty about food can lead to increased anxiety and depression. Despite these hardships, many affected individuals remain resilient and hopeful for a more food-secure future.
