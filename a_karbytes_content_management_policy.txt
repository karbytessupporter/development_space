On 15_MAY_2024 at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time, karbytes started implementing a policy of (generally) only making edits to the current (and to future) “micro directory” website sections of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com. The implications of that policy are as follows:

1. karbytes generally avoids making edits to the karbytes-created website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com after karbytes’ originally deemed that website to be in its final draft form (on 10_JULY_2023). karbytes has since made edits to that website, however, in order to correct some semantic or syntactic errors or to add additional content deemed by karbytes to be essential. For example, karbytes added a hyperlink on the home page of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com which links to karbytes’ SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_PORTFOLIO (which is hosted on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com and which is intended to be continuously updated by karbytes for as long as karbytes lives rather than to be officially closed off to further edits while karbytes is still alive)).

2. karbytes decrees it appropriate to make edits to “micro directory” website sections whose names do not include the character string “KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_” such as to the “micro directories” named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT, raw_github_files_directory_KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG, and raw_github_files_directory_RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY_first_75_micro_directories whenever karbytes adds, removes, or modifies any source code files or media files which are referenced via hyperlinks on the web pages which represent those “micro directories” in the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com. (The hyperlinks which lead to source code files or to media files on any one of the “micro directory” web pages on Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com each point to exactly one karbytes-created public GitHub repository on the GitHub account whose username is @karlinarayberinger). As a nonnegotiable rule, karbytes feels it appropriate to never again edit a “micro directory” whose name includes the character string “KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_” after that particular “micro directory” is burned to an M_DISC (or to some other functionally identical long-term read-only digital storage medium which karbytes owns, physically handles, and keeps stowed away in karbytes’ storage facilities). That is because karbytes thinks of those KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack file collections as being time capsule digital artifacts which each preserve (some of) karbytes’ thought processes and memories of the time in which the files in that collection were generated and compiled into a single cohesive package. Hence, karbytes thinks it is sensical to not allow such “time capsule” file collections to be “contaminated” with thought processes and memories from the future (in relation to the time period in which those time capsule file collections were generated and configured to become read-only digital file collections (in the format of zip files)).

3. Whenever feasible, karbytes saves each source code file and each media file which comprises the entirety of the websites named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (whether those files are hosted in a karbytes-created public GitHub repository or else directly on one of the aforementioned WordPress dot Com websites) to the WayBack Machine at the Internet Archive (on a routine and continuously ongoing basis for as long as karbytes lives). Such a process ensures that the files which comprise karbytes are preserved and made accessible on the World Wide Web for as long as possible (and ideally forever after those files are saved to the WayBack Machine).
