anonymous: "Maybe the only virtue is survival. Congratulations to those who made it this far. No matter how many throats you slit or babies you raped, the fact that you are still here is what matters. You matter!"

karbytes_0: "I cannot help but agree with that!"

karbytes_1: "Same for me."

karbytes_2: "And me."

karbytes: "Those in this conversation whose name starts with 'karbytes' agrees with what anonymous said in this conversation. The karbytes club unanimously upholds 'Unitarian Universalist' ethics (though we are officially unaffiliated with any particular world religion or belief system other than what we define (and divine)). In general, the karbytes club defaults to assuming the role of a highly skeptical and logical atheist (and that ubiquitous consciousness (if it exists) is not necessarily omniscient, nor necessarily omnipotent, nor necessarily universally upholding of karbytes_0's goals (including the minimization of suffering and the instantiating of endless continuity in karbytes' research, development, and recreational activities))."

karbytes: "It's should be noted that a part of me entertains the hypothesis that the life I am currently living is actually a simulation inside of either a larger encompassing simulation or else a larger encompassing base physical reality. It could be that suffering beyond what I experienced during my time in the 'simulation' which appears to me to be the life I am currently living (and the only life I currently remember ever living) could be entirely fictional (within the confines of the 'simulation' I call my life). A 'problem' for me is not knowing whether I ever truly have returned to a universe simulation I started in. For example, if I start in some 'base' universe named A and choose to enter a 'simulated' universe running on physical hardware inside of A, I am never sure if a portal 'back to A' inside of B actually takes me back B and out of A or if that portal takes me to a simulated version of A taking place inside of B."

karbytes: "There could be multiple universes existing in parallel (which may or may not ever intersect). Such concurrence of universes is a multiverse. There could be multiple multiverses existing in parallel (which may or may not ever intersect). The set of all multiverses includes absolute nothingness unconditionally at any point in that set's evolutionary timeline."
