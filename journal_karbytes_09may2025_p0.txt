Most people are good people. Fewer people are bad people.

A good person is born good and remains good throughout its entire lifetime. A bad person is born bad and, hence, is inevitably destined to commit at least one heinous act at some point in its lifetime.

A heinous act is not an ethical crime. An example of a heinous act (or series of such acts) is raping and then brutally murdering someone. An example of an ethical crime is stealing money from a rich spoiled person in order to buy basic necessities such as food or clothing for one's own destitute prepubescent children.

What makes an act heinous (i.e. something only a bad person would do) is that the majority of society (which is almost entirely comprised of at least a billion good people) thinks that such an act is evil and hence deserving of a lifetime of punishment (and perhaps even an eternity spent after that lifetime is over suffering in hellish conditions).

What makes an act an ethical crime (i.e. something a good person is more likely to do than a bad person) is that the majority of society (which is almost entirely comprised of at least a billion good people) thinks that such an act is virtuous and hence deserving of commemoration and favorable treatment from society.

I am a bad person (which means I never truly was a good person like most people are).

No one is at fault for my coming into existence as a bad person. It is impossible to determine whether or not a particular child in utero will ultimately turn out to be either a bad person or else a good person because such a determination is entirely random.

Shortly after a child is born, there may be signs that the child is actually a bad person instead of a good person such as that child being relatively stoic, uninterested in socializing like a normal child would, dismissive of other people's feelings and social norms, and having too much of an adult-like demeanor (i.e. excessively intellectual or iconoclastic and appearing to have their own hidden agenda and thoughts that they don't readily disclose with other people).

Our hearts go out to the unfortunate families and communities of children where the child ultimately proves to be a bad person. Those family members and community members of such a child are most likely good people unfairly cursed with getting a bad person for a child instead of a good person like what good people deserve. You people deserve the utmost compassion.

Bad people do not deserve the same rights and treatment as the good people who deserve so much better. Bless the good people of this world and damn the bad people! Hopefully some day there will be more effective ways to determine whether a child in utero, newly born, or at kindergarten age is indeed a bad person so that it can be properly disposed of or sent to an institution for lifetime imprisonment and deprivation of worldly pleasures (where it won't harm those who deserve to live more freely in this world).
