<p>I recently explored a high-end website named <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.intimaterose.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intimate Rose</a> which sells vaginal (and anal) dildos made of medical-grade silicone. (I personally think silicone feels too &#8220;grippy&#8221; (i.e. high in friction) and is gross due to the fact that it contains microscopic pores which enable bacteria to colonize inside of them (which leads to bad smells and bodily infections). Hence, I almost always avoid purchasing and using any of such product which is not a solid object made of entirely one of the following: borosilicate glass (and not lime glass, et cetera) or medical-grade metal alloy (i.e. stainless steel)). The dildos at the aforementioned website are specific graduated dimensions which start at a relatively small size (in terms of length and diameter) and end at a relatively large size (in terms of length and diameter). Such objects are used to gradually stretch the vaginal (or anal) opening such that larger sizes become less painful and actually enjoyable (in terms of being penetrated by such objects). I basically (&#8220;on the fly&#8221;) developed my own personalized (yet possibly quite generic) <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/glass_dildo_obsession_adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vaginal dilation</a> procedure (or program (due to the fact that it occurs inside of exactly one unique space-time continuum)) which occurs within the span of approximately three to six months. That seems to be a great metaphor for the <strong>karbytes</strong> software project (which is a self-sustaining and self-augmenting &#8220;body&#8221; (and emergent &#8220;mind&#8221;) comprised of software files (fundamentally reducible to discrete (i.e. finite) sequences of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/bits_and_bytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zeroes and ones</a>) referred to by karbytes as &#8220;karbytes&#8221;).</p>
<p><em>I do <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/foot_care_items/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;market research&#8221;</a> as a hobby. I find it to be quite fun and addicting. That addiction helps keep me alive.</em></p>
