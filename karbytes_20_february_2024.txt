In yesterday's note (which is the plain-text file named karbytes_19_february_2024 and which is referenced via hyperlink by the web page named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_8 on the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com), I said that I would put three M_DISC copies of the collection of zip files (organized inside of one folder) named karbytes_23february2024_core and three M_DISC copies of the collection of zip files (organized inside of one folder) named karbytes_23february2024_journals inside of one of the fire-proof zip-locking compact disc cases which I recently ordered from Amazon dot Com. (At the moment, all of my recently-placed Amazon dot Com orders are said to be delayed (apparently due to incorrect package routing from Oakland to Tracy instead of from Oakland to Castro Valley) to the extent that I might have to re-order them (but I still expect to get all those discs which I talked about burning in karbytes_19_february_2024 done and properly stowed away by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_APRIL_2024).

What I wanted to say in this journal entry (which is the plain-text file named karbytes_20_february_2024 and which is referenced via hyperlink by the web page named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_8 on the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) is that, because I plan on destroying (i.e. rendering unreadable) and then discarding the 16_FEBRUARY_2024 M_DISC copy of karbytes_23february2024_core and the 16_FEBRUARY_2024 M_DISC copy of karbytes_23february2024_journals which are currently stored inside of the white binder inside of the metal box which I reserved for storing what I consider to be the most essential karbytes content backups, I now plan on replacing those destroyed and discarded copies in the white binder with one copy of each of the newer M_DISC copies of those data collections which I intend to burn (and properly stow away) no later than 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_APRIL_2024. As a result, each of the two fire-proof zip-locking compact disc cases I ordered will each initially store two M_DISC copies of (post 16_FEBRUARY_2024) karbytes_23february2024_core and two M_DISC copies of (post 16_FEBRUARY_2024) karbytes_23february2024_journals.
