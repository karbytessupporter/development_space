The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o which took place between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_MAY_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 01_JUNE_2025. The conversation pertains to karbytes requesting the generation of an image which is a cartoonish depiction of karbytes driving a car along some winding alpine road while looking very agitated (and animated) for use as the still image in MP4 video files made from MP3 audio files of deliberately annoying sound effects karbytes recorded of itself making for use in a "sonic weapon" application which will be hosted as a live web application on GitHub (but not also on karbytes' dark web server due to the fact that the dark web server tends to be a lot less reliable than the GitHub web app server). 

That web application uses the same essential logic as what the multi-track sound player app featured in the following tutorial web page uses:

karbytes:

Generate an image of a crazy, angry car driver with their hair standing on end, eyes bulging out of their skull, and which vaguely looks like me. Give them an orange shirt and have the car going down a winding road through forested mountains.

ChatGPT:

Sure! Please upload a photo of yourself so I can generate an image that vaguely resembles you. Once I have that, Iâ€™ll create the scene with the crazy, angry driver in an orange shirt barreling down a winding mountain road.

karbytes:

That's excellent. It will do just fine for my latest app that I'm making.

ChatGPT:

I'm glad you like it! Let me know if you need any variations, interface mockups, or help integrating it into your app.
