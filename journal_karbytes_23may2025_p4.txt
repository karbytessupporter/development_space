Some people keep harassing me. Until they stop harassing me, I might abuse people other than myself (and not report how) as a means of getting some relief (however tepid and temporary it may be) and "fucked up" sense of "justice". If some relatively powerful people continuously get away with abusing me, I might as well also try getting away with abusing people. 

Then you can say I'm not any more ethical and well-behaved than whoever my tormentors are (and my tormentors seem to never get punished nor stopped from doing whatever they please). 

There! Now I'm no longer a good role model for human children. Instead, I am someone to loathe, fear, and prevent from having nice things. 

Consider this written evidence that I am very likely to intentionally inflict harm on people other than myself in the form of property damage, theft, or physical violence which may result in serious injury or death. 

If I was not subject to so much cruel treatment from the pigs I described as being immune to legal, social, financial, or medical consequences of their actions (particularly actions which amount to treating me like someone to bully and torture mercilessly and to an extent that causes me serious harm (because it has in the form of significant long-term emotional distress, physical health decline, and disruption to my attempts to improve my life circumstances and interpersonal relationships)), I would not make this public threat. I understand I may have increased the likelihood that my tormentors and others will try to harm me by disclosing these threats. On the same line of reasoning, my attempts to simply mind my own business and make the most of what I have have been met with sabotaging attempts by my tormentors. I might end up harming the children of my tormentors in overt acts of violence (just to spite my tormentors and show them how their children nor themselves are not necessarily safe from brutality and inhumane treatment). They "chose" to have kids. The consequences is that their kids might get kidnapped, tortured, and killed. Lastly, I doubt my tormentors would want their own kids nor themselves to be on the receiving end of the treatment those tormentors inflict on me. I just hope someone deprives them of safety, serenity, and kindness and relegates them to a long-term position of being ignored, impoverished, and bullied. Those families are vermin to me and I feel no opposition to them being murdered. 

Some women seem like people the men in their lives and society would treat like vermin deserving of violence and hateful treatment if it wasn't for the fact those women allow men to impregnate them. Those women, to me, seem like little more than dumber, weaker, brattier, and more annoying versions of the men whose cocks they suck and kiss up to like the charity cases they are. Those men only "love" those women for their sexual reproductive capacities and little else (because those women have so little else to offer anyone).

Yes I'm a misogynist. Yes I'm a misanthropist. Yes I'm pro genocide. These words only have as much power as readers give them (and humans sure love to read sensationalist garbage and get all emotionally worked up and self-righteous about it (while avoiding academic and scientific rigor at all costs)). Humans need to vehemently defend their patriarchy's ego like their lives depend on it. That patriarchy is what gives them their power, their basic material commodities, their weapons, their shields, their communities, their only sense of "purpose" in life. Huddle around his majesty's all-important penis. It is the source of your privileged life and self-worth. Without him, you are nameless casualties of war; not worthy of being remembered. Only those who get away with murder, genocide, and monopolization of the media and the markets deserve to have a safe place to sleep and monuments in their name.
