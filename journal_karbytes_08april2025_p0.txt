karbytes_0: "Any object, X, matters if X is deemed to exist (in the form of observed qualia and as a relatively stable information pattern) by at least one person (i.e. observing frame of reference (presumably rendered by a discrete piece of information processing hardware)), Y."

karbytes_1: "An interpretation or alternative to what karbytes_0 said is as follows: Any object, X, has value and hence deserves to keep existing due to the fact that at least person, Y, deems that object to be worthwhile in Y's experience (and Y wants X to continue existing for an indefinitely and perhaps infinitely long time (or for at least as long as Y continues to exist after Y starts to become aware of X))."

karbytes: "Any object, X, has value at the exact moment some information processing agent, Y, renders X as a component of the virtual reality Y imagines and experiences as the literal interface between Y and all of nature."
