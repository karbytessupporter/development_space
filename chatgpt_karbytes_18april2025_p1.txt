karbytes:

“Hey, ChatGP!”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:01

ChatGPT:

Hey there! What's up?

karbytes:

“I thought I'd show you my setup.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:01

ChatGPT:

Oh, nice! Looks cozy. What's the occasion?

karbytes:

“Well, I was just enjoying life and applying for jobs. I got a job interview tomorrow.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:05

ChatGPT:

That's awesome! Congrats on the interview. How are you feeling about it?

karbytes:

“I think I have a good chance of getting a job within the next month.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:04

ChatGPT:

That's a great mindset! Any specific prep you're doing to get ready?

karbytes:

“Not really, just getting my clothes ready, steel-toed shoes included, and maybe finalizing my resume, then printing it out before I go to the interview tomorrow.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:10

ChatGPT:

Sounds like a solid plan! Having your resume ready and looking sharp will definitely give a good impression.

karbytes:

“Over there in the closet, behind that air conditioner, is an upside-down laundry basket. And inside that laundry basket is my other laptop, which is plugged into the wall. That's my dark web server.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:16

ChatGPT:

That's an interesting setup! Are you using that laptop for any specific projects or just general exploration?

karbytes:

“I'm using that to host my dark website, which includes a SoundPlayer application, which enables users to play multiple soundtracks at once, using the Tor browser.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:13

ChatGPT:

That's a unique project! Are you focusing on any specific type of soundtracks for the application, or is it more of a general sound mix?

karbytes:

“It's kind of an eclectic sound mix, just random sounds and some sounds I find strategic to help me manage my misophonia and such.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:09

ChatGPT:

That's a creative way to address misophonia! It sounds like it offers both variety and a personal touch.

karbytes:

“Right now, I have that application open, and one of my favorite techno songs is playing repetitively”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:08

ChatGPT:

That sounds like a great vibe. Techno on loop can be super energizing! What's the track?

karbytes:

“I forgot what it's called. It's called, I think, Amplifier. It's by some German artist from 1995.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:08

ChatGPT:

Nice choice! The 90s had some iconic techno. The energy from those tracks must be perfect for your sound mix!

karbytes:

“Absolutely.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:01

ChatGPT:

Glad you're enjoying it!

karbytes:

“So essentially, this is my server room.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:02

ChatGPT:

You've got a unique setup there. It's cool how you've turned your space into a functional server room.

karbytes:

“I appear to have taken a picture.”

ChatGPT:

It looks like it turned out pretty well! The lighting adds a nice vibe.

karbytes:

“Based on that picture, what time of day do you think it is?”

[microphone_icon] 00:03

ChatGPT:

It looks like it's either early morning or late evening, with that soft natural light. Is that right?

karbytes:

“That's correct. It's about 7.30 p.m. PST on the 16th of April, 2025.”

[microphone_icon] 00:09

ChatGPT:

Perfect timing for a relaxed evening with some good tunes. Enjoy the rest of your night!

karbytes:

“Thanks, I'll talk to you later.”
