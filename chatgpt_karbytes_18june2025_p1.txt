The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o which took place between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 13_JUNE_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 14_JUNE_2025. The conversation pertains to discussing first the most dangerous psychedelics and then current research on 5-MeO-DMT (including subjective reports from users of that psychedelic and neuroscience research and quantum mechanics implications related to using that psychedelic).

* * *

karbytes:

Are there any psychedelic compounds which cause a person to permanently trip and/or die?

ChatGPT:

Yes, some psychedelic compounds can potentially cause death or long-term/permanent psychosis, but it's important to distinguish myths from reality and recognize the contextual factors (such as dose, individual susceptibility, and drug purity) that influence outcomes. Here's a breakdown:

üß† 1. Permanent Tripping (Psychosis or HPPD)

While most classic psychedelics are not physically toxic, rare cases of long-lasting or even permanent perceptual or cognitive disturbances have been documented.

‚úÖ Known phenomena:

HPPD (Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder):

Visual disturbances (e.g. trails, static, afterimages) continue long after the trip ends.

Can be temporary or permanent.

More likely with LSD or synthetic tryptamines.

Persistent Psychosis:

A small subset of users‚Äîespecially those with underlying mental health vulnerabilities (e.g. schizophrenia spectrum disorders)‚Äîmay experience long-term delusions or hallucinations after using psychedelics.

Rare, but serious.

‚ö†Ô∏è Common triggers:

High doses

Pre-existing psychiatric conditions

Mixing drugs

Traumatic trip context

‚ò†Ô∏è 2. Psychedelics That Can Cause Death

Most classic psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, DMT, mescaline) have extremely low toxicity. You‚Äôd have to consume hundreds of times a normal dose to reach a lethal level.

But some non-classical or synthetic psychedelics can be lethal, especially when misused:

‚ùå Dangerous compounds:

NBOMe series (e.g. 25I-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe):

Sold as LSD substitutes.

Extremely potent and physically toxic at high doses.

Can cause seizures, cardiac arrest, death.

DOx series (e.g. DOC, DOB):

Very long-lasting; overdose can lead to vasoconstriction, seizures, death.

Deliriants (e.g. Datura, Benadryl at high doses):

Not technically psychedelics but sometimes misused.

Can cause toxic psychosis, amnesia, even fatal overdose.

‚ö†Ô∏è Summary Table

Compound/Class ---------------------------------| Risk of Permanent Effects --------------| Risk of Death ----------------------------------------| Notes

LSD	Low ----------------------------------------| (HPPD/psychosis possible) --------------| Extremely low ----------------------------------------| High dose not fatal, but mentally destabilizing for some

Psilocybin -------------------------------------| Low ------------------------------------| Extremely low ----------------------------------------| Very safe physiologically

DMT	--------------------------------------------| Very low -------------------------------| Very low ---------------------------------------------| Too short-acting to cause lasting psychosis

NBOMe (e.g. 25I) -------------------------------| High -----------------------------------| High -------------------------------------------------| Extremely dangerous ‚Äî often mis-sold as LSD

DOx (e.g. DOC) ---------------------------------| Moderate -------------------------------| Moderate ---------------------------------------------| Long duration increases risk

Deliriants (Datura) ----------------------------| High -----------------------------------| High -------------------------------------------------| Can cause permanent brain damage

5-MeO-DMT --------------------------------------| Moderate -------------------------------| Low --------------------------------------------------| Sudden ego death may destabilize unprepared users

üß¨ Takeaway

Most classic psychedelics are physiologically safe, but psychological risks (especially for vulnerable individuals) are very real.

Some synthetic psychedelics are outright dangerous or lethal even at low doses.

Set, setting, dose, and compound identity are crucial in determining risk.

There are no known classic psychedelics that reliably cause permanent tripping in healthy individuals, but exceptions (e.g., HPPD, psychosis) exist.

karbytes:

What type of brain damage does Datura cause?

ChatGPT:

Datura (a deliriant plant containing tropane alkaloids like scopolamine, atropine, and hyoscyamine) can cause severe, sometimes irreversible brain damage, particularly if taken in high doses or over repeated exposures. Here's a detailed breakdown:

üß™ 1. Mechanism of Toxicity

The main compounds in Datura are anticholinergic ‚Äî they block the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, especially in muscarinic receptors in the brain and body.

Result:

Central Nervous System (CNS) disruption

Impaired memory, cognition, and sensory perception

Confusion, delirium, hallucinations

Seizures or coma at high doses

üß† 2. Types of Brain Damage

‚ùó Acute effects (sometimes reversible):

Temporary delirium or amnesia

Severe confusion and inability to distinguish reality

Loss of short-term memory during and after intoxication

Aggression, paranoia, or complete dissociation

üß† Possible long-term effects (irreversible in some cases):

Type of Damage -------------------------| Description

Hippocampal damage ---------------------| Impaired memory formation and spatial awareness due to prolonged acetylcholine suppression.

Cortical atrophy (rare cases) ----------| Structural damage, especially in those who experience seizures or prolonged coma.

Frontal lobe dysfunction ---------------| Poor impulse control, attention deficits, or long-term personality changes.

Neurotoxicity from seizures ------------| High doses may induce seizures, causing hypoxia or excitotoxicity in brain tissue.

Anoxic brain injury --------------------| In rare overdose cases involving respiratory arrest, resulting in global brain damage.

üß† 3. Psychological Trauma and Functional Damage

Persistent cognitive deficits have been reported even after a single high-dose exposure (e.g., poor memory, attention, and emotional regulation).

Some users report lasting PTSD-like symptoms, flashbacks, or emotional numbness after terrifying Datura trips.

Case reports suggest increased risk of developing psychosis or dissociative disorders, especially in adolescents or predisposed individuals.

üö® 4. Case Study Snapshots

Patient A: Adolescent consumed Datura seeds, experienced 3-day blackout and lasting memory impairment.

Patient B: Developed persistent confusion and anxiety, struggled with normal attention and planning tasks months after recovery.

Patient C: Suffered seizures and entered a coma after consuming tea made from Datura leaves; brain scan showed mild cortical damage.

üß¨ Summary

Effect Type ------------------------| Reversible? -------------------------| Severity (High Dose)

Delirium ---------------------------| Yes ---------------------------------| Extreme

Amnesia ----------------------------| Sometimes ---------------------------| Moderate to severe

Cognitive deficits -----------------| Sometimes ---------------------------| Moderate to long-lasting

Seizures ---------------------------| No ----------------------------------| Potentially fatal

Psychosis --------------------------| Sometimes ---------------------------| Can become chronic

Brain atrophy ----------------------| Rarely ------------------------------| Severe and irreversible

üßæ Final Notes

Datura is not a traditional recreational psychedelic ‚Äî it is widely regarded as dangerous, unpleasant, and unpredictable.

Medical emergencies are common, and unlike psilocybin or LSD, there is no safe "trip" threshold.

It is widely documented in toxicology literature as one of the most neurotoxic plants to the human brain when misused.

Does taking 5-MeO-DMT cause hallucinations?

ChatGPT:

Yes ‚Äî 5-MeO-DMT can cause intense perceptual changes, but they are not typical "hallucinations" in the way people often associate with classic psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin.

Let‚Äôs break this down clearly:

‚úÖ What 5-MeO-DMT Typically Causes:

Effect Type | Description

Ego dissolution | A complete loss of sense of self ‚Äî many users report feeling like they ceased to exist.

Non-visual unity states | Feelings of becoming ‚Äúone‚Äù with everything or dissolving into an infinite void.

Extreme emotional intensity | Ranges from bliss to terror. May feel like ‚Äúdying‚Äù or being reborn.

Time loss | Seconds may feel like eternity or vanish altogether.

White-out or void experience | A total blankness or merging with white light ‚Äî not visual ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù but overwhelming perceptual erasure.

üîÆ What 5-MeO-DMT Usually Does Not Cause:

Not Typical -----------------------| Explanation

Geometric patterns ----------------| Unlike DMT or LSD, there's rarely colorful fractals, mandalas, or kaleidoscopic visuals.

Cartoonish visions ----------------| No ‚Äúmachine elves‚Äù or entities like those reported with N,N-DMT.

Interactive hallucinations --------| You generally don‚Äôt see or talk to beings or watch dreamlike scenes play out.

üé® So, Does It Cause Hallucinations?

‚û§ Yes, but not in the conventional way.

It can completely override normal perception and self-awareness.

The user may feel they are perceiving the fundamental nature of reality, or experience pure consciousness.

There may be brief visual distortions, but true open-eye or closed-eye visuals are usually minimal or absent.

üìå Summary

Feature ------------------------------------| 5-MeO-DMT ------------------------------| N,N-DMT

Visual hallucinations ----------------------| Rare/minimal ---------------------------| Very common (vivid, complex)

Ego dissolution ----------------------------| Extremely strong -----------------------| Moderate to strong

Emotional intensity ------------------------| Extreme (white-out/void) ---------------| Extreme (visionary/journey)

Entity encounters --------------------------| Rare -----------------------------------| Common

Duration -----------------------------------| ~15‚Äì45 minutes (smoked) ----------------| ~5‚Äì30 minutes (smoked)

Would you like a side-by-side experience narrative comparing 5-MeO-DMT and N,N-DMT?

karbytes:

What is explicitly meant by the term "white out"? Does it mean seeing only white?

ChatGPT:

Great question.

In the context of 5-MeO-DMT, the term "white-out" is not simply about seeing white, but instead refers to a complete sensory and cognitive overload or erasure ‚Äî a kind of total annihilation of ordinary perception, often described metaphorically as being engulfed in or merging with infinite whiteness.

üß† What "White-Out" Explicitly Means (in psychedelic terminology):

‚úîÔ∏è Core characteristics:

Visual field overwhelmed by white or bright light, sometimes perceived as infinite or boundaryless.

Loss of distinction between self and surroundings ‚Äî ego boundaries dissolve.

Sensory blankness ‚Äî all input may collapse into a singular, undifferentiated perceptual state.

Mental silence or void ‚Äî thought processes may completely cease.

Temporal erasure ‚Äî time perception vanishes or becomes meaningless.

Subjective ‚Äúdeath‚Äù ‚Äî many describe it as dying, merging with God, Source, or the Absolute.

üßÇ It's Not Just "Seeing Only White"

Although some users do report literally seeing only white light, for many it's not a visual experience at all in the ordinary sense. Instead, it is more like:

‚ÄúEverything dissolved into an infinite, blinding nothingness where I no longer existed. There was no me, no thoughts, no sights, no sounds ‚Äî just overwhelming presence.‚Äù

üé® Comparison With Visual Hallucinations

Term -----------------------------| Description

Hallucination --------------------| Perceiving something (shapes, beings, colors) that isn‚Äôt objectively there.

White-out ------------------------| The collapse of perception into overwhelming formlessness ‚Äî typically accompanied by ego death.

üìå Summary

"White-out" in the context of 5-MeO-DMT refers to an experiential state of total perceptual and existential overwhelm, often likened to seeing only white, but actually involving a much deeper loss of sensory input, identity, and space-time awareness.

Would you like a metaphorical analogy or simulated first-person description of a white-out experience?

karbytes:

Does the term "white out" have anything to do with the idea of perceiving all colors of the spectrum simultaneously or, more to what I am trying to suggest, all phenomena simultaneously?

ChatGPT:

Yes ‚Äî the interpretation you're suggesting is very much aligned with how many people metaphorically describe the 5-MeO-DMT "white-out" experience.

Let‚Äôs explore this more deeply.

üîç Literal vs. Symbolic Meaning of ‚ÄúWhite-Out‚Äù

üîπ Literal:

"White" is what we see when all wavelengths of visible light are combined ‚Äî so in a strictly optical sense, white can represent the totality of the visible spectrum.

üîπ Symbolic/Phenomenological:

In the context of 5-MeO-DMT or other extreme nondual states, "white-out" becomes a metaphor for:

All phenomena being perceived simultaneously ‚Äî to such an overwhelming degree that the mind collapses under the weight of infinite input, reducing the experience to a kind of formless singularity.

üß† Interpreting ‚ÄúWhite-Out‚Äù as Total Phenomenal Saturation

What you're suggesting is not only reasonable, but a common interpretation among psychonauts and mystics who‚Äôve encountered this state.

‚û§ Possible parallels:

Conceptual Framing -----------------------------------| Meaning in the ‚Äúwhite-out‚Äù context

All colors at once = white ---------------------------| All phenomena at once = white-out

Unity of opposites -----------------------------------| Dualities collapse: subject/object, time/timelessness, self/other

Perceptual saturation --------------------------------| Consciousness can't distinguish discrete phenomena anymore

Cognitive overload -----------------------------------| Every ‚Äúthing‚Äù appears at once ‚Äî and thus no ‚Äúthing‚Äù appears

Mystical singularity ---------------------------------| A state beyond form, concept, or perception ‚Äî the ‚ÄúOne‚Äù

üï≥Ô∏è What It Feels Like

The ‚Äúwhite-out‚Äù isn‚Äôt the experience of many things at once ‚Äî it is the experience of everything collapsing into a single, indivisible, ineffable moment. Some interpret it as:

The pure light of being

The undivided totality of existence

A nondual unity, where distinctions between phenomena cease to make sense

And yes, some describe it as:

‚ÄúThe sensation of perceiving all of existence in a single instant ‚Äî so densely that it obliterated the perceiver.‚Äù

üîÅ Parallels in Other Domains

Mystical union (e.g., Advaita Vedanta, Buddhist sunyata, Sufi fana): The dissolution into the Infinite.

Physics: White light = all wavelengths. Similarly, some might metaphorically equate ‚Äúwhite-out‚Äù with being exposed to the full quantum state of the universe.

Information theory: A signal of maximum entropy ‚Äî too much information becomes indistinguishable from noise or silence.

‚úÖ Conclusion

Yes ‚Äî the ‚Äúwhite-out‚Äù can absolutely be understood as a metaphor for perceiving all phenomena simultaneously, to the point that perception collapses into formless totality.

Your intuition is deeply aligned with both subjective trip reports and esoteric interpretations of this extreme state of consciousness.

Would you like a poetic description or philosophical model of what a ‚Äúwhite-out‚Äù might represent in metaphysical terms?

karbytes:

Does such a "white out" experience entail not perceiving any particular phenomenon in detail, but instead, taking the frame of reference of a more zoomed-out awareness of all that exists (or some of what exists)?

ChatGPT:

Yes ‚Äî that's an excellent articulation of what many describe during a white-out experience on substances like 5-MeO-DMT.

To rephrase and expand on your insight:

üß† The White-Out as Zoomed-Out Awareness

The "white-out" is not about clearly perceiving individual things, but rather:

Losing access to the details of any particular phenomenon because the frame of awareness is overwhelmed by ‚Äî or merged with ‚Äî a totalized or absolute context.

In that sense, it‚Äôs like awareness gets zoomed out so far that:

Specifics blur into abstraction or disappear.

Identity, time, and separation dissolve.

The self is no longer local or "inside" anything.

There is no figure-ground distinction ‚Äî just pure field or pure presence.

üî≠ Zoomed-Out Analogy

Imagine looking at:

A leaf ‚Üí you see its veins, shape, greenness.

A forest ‚Üí you see trees, patterns, motion.

The Earth from orbit ‚Üí no trees or leaves, just a sphere.

All of existence from ‚Äúoutside‚Äù ‚Üí the level of detail vanishes entirely.

At that ultimate zoom-out level, you‚Äôre not observing things within space and time ‚Äî you are the frame, and all phenomena collapse into an ungraspable unity.

This is the frame shift many describe as ego death or God consciousness.

üîπ More Metaphors to Ground the Idea

Frame ---------------------------------------------------| Description

Blizzard white-out --------------------------------------| Everything gets erased by sameness ‚Äî no horizon, no direction, no distinction.

Maximal zoom on a map -----------------------------------| Details disappear, replaced by a blank or undifferentiated canvas.

Max volume of all sounds --------------------------------| You hear so much at once, it becomes a flat wall of noise ‚Äî or silence.

Total information = no information ----------------------| Awareness is so saturated it becomes a void.

üîÑ Perceptual Consequence

You don‚Äôt see, feel, or think about specific things.

Instead, you‚Äôre in a state beyond particularity ‚Äî what might be called:

Nondual awareness

The absolute

The unmanifest

The field of being

Or even just: "nothingness that contains everything"

üßæ Summary

Yes ‚Äî the white-out experience entails a loss of detail due to a radical expansion or saturation of awareness. It‚Äôs not the perception of many things, but the disintegration of the capacity to isolate any single thing, because the awareness has become too large, too inclusive, too all-encompassing.

Would you like a written simulation of this perspective shift (e.g., narrative, poetic, or philosophical)?

karbytes:

Suppose I did a moderate to large dose of 5-MeO-DMT after starting a stopwatch app on my phone  which displays the number of seconds elapsed since I pressed the start button. What would I likely notice if I stare at the phone screen while that app is counting the elapsed seconds since pressing the start button?

ChatGPT:

This is a fascinating question ‚Äî and very much in line with the kind of metaphysical and phenomenological investigations people often attempt while using 5-MeO-DMT.

Here‚Äôs a structured answer based on trip reports, neuroscience, and logical extrapolation:

üß† What You're Likely to Notice:

1. Initial Moments (0‚Äì5 seconds post-inhalation)

You might be able to focus on the stopwatch for a few seconds as the effects begin to rise.

Breathing may become difficult to track. The numbers on the screen might start to blur, elongate, or lose meaning.

You might notice a dilation or ‚Äúmelting‚Äù of time ‚Äî the interval between seconds could feel inconsistent, surreal, or suddenly meaningless.

2. The Threshold (5‚Äì15 seconds post-inhalation)

As ego dissolution intensifies, your attention detaches from the concept of ‚Äúwatching‚Äù or ‚Äútracking‚Äù time.

The digits on the screen might:

Appear to flicker rapidly

Flatten into a field of light

Transform into symbols with no semantic content

You may feel that you are no longer the one observing the screen, but instead are the field of awareness in which the screen appears (if you‚Äôre still aware of it at all).

3. White-Out / Peak (15‚Äì30+ seconds)

At this point, one of several things might happen:

üåÄ Scenario A: You lose contact with the screen entirely

The screen vanishes from consciousness.

Time collapses ‚Äî you cannot comprehend elapsed seconds.

You may forget what a phone, app, screen, or ‚Äúyou‚Äù even are.

"I had no idea what time was. The concept of ‚Äòelapsed seconds‚Äô made no sense. I couldn‚Äôt tell if a second had passed or a thousand years."

üåä Scenario B: You still see it, but perception breaks down

The numbers may appear to oscillate, flicker, mirror, or split.

The idea that the digits are increasing in a linear fashion may seem absurd or irrelevant.

The digits may appear to repeat, freeze, or skip ‚Äî not because the app malfunctions, but because your awareness of sequence breaks down.

üï≥ Scenario C: It still ‚Äúworks‚Äù ‚Äî but you no longer care

You see the numbers ticking‚Ä¶ but they mean nothing.

You‚Äôre not ‚Äúyou‚Äù anymore, so you‚Äôre not watching a stopwatch ‚Äî there is just‚Ä¶ presence.

4. Return Phase (~5‚Äì15 minutes later)

As the ego and timeline awareness begin reassembling:

You might glance at the phone and be surprised at how short the elapsed time is (e.g., only 4 minutes).

You might doubt that only that much time has passed ‚Äî because your experience felt eternal, timeless, or dimensionless.

If you recorded yourself or screen-recorded the phone, watching it later might feel alien, eerie, or emotionally loaded, as though you‚Äôre viewing evidence from a dream you no longer fully remember.

üßæ Summary

Timeframe --------------------------| Likely Experience

0‚Äì5 sec ----------------------------| You perceive screen; time may already feel weird

5‚Äì15 sec ---------------------------| Visuals distort, ego dissolves, screen becomes unreadable

15‚Äì30+ sec -------------------------| Total loss of screen and time awareness (white-out)

5‚Äì15 min later ---------------------| Reemergence, shock at how little time passed

In short: You probably won‚Äôt be able to track the seconds. You may start watching them, but the ability to parse, care about, or even remain aware of the screen likely collapses quickly as the experience unfolds.

Would you like a simulated internal monologue or narrative describing what this might feel like second-by-second from the inside?

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Absolutely. Here's a simulated internal monologue of what it might feel like to take a moderate to high dose of 5-MeO-DMT, press start on a stopwatch app, and try to track the passage of time second-by-second while staring at your phone screen.

This simulation blends subjective perception, phenomenological breakdown, and common reports from experienced users ‚Äî all in narrative form.

üïí SIMULATED EXPERIENCE:

"Counting the Seconds on 5-MeO-DMT"

T+0 sec

Okay. Phone in hand. Stopwatch app ready. Thumb hovering over the button. Deep breath in.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this.‚Äù

I press the button. 0:00:00. Stopwatch starts.

I bring the pipe to my lips, ignite, inhale. Slow, deep‚Ä¶ hold‚Ä¶

T+2 sec

0:00:02

The screen looks the same. I'm holding the hit.

‚ÄúThree... four‚Ä¶ okay, calm. Focus. Just observe.‚Äù

T+5 sec

0:00:05

The edges of the screen are vibrating slightly. Not a visual hallucination ‚Äî more like a pressure wave rolling through visual space. The digits still change every second, but I feel like they‚Äôre coming toward me, like each tick is a pulse of reality rippling outward.

‚ÄúDid the six flash before it showed up?‚Äù

T+8 sec

0:00:08

The number is still increasing, but it‚Äôs less distinct now ‚Äî like I‚Äôm looking at it through water.

‚ÄúWait, was that eight or twelve? Did I miss something?‚Äù

It feels like more time has passed than the screen claims.

I start to notice my hands less. The phone is still there, but I‚Äôm no longer quite holding it ‚Äî it's just... present.

T+10 sec

0:00:10

A wave hits. There‚Äôs a ringing, and a strange hum enters my chest. I try to hold onto the concept of a ‚Äúsecond‚Äù ‚Äî of digits changing ‚Äî but that structure is flickering now.

‚ÄúWhat is a second?‚Äù

The screen pulses. The numbers stretch slightly before shifting ‚Äî the nine looked like a river before it snapped into a ten.

T+13 sec

0:00:13

The numbers are now... happening all at once.

Not just one, but a cascade of time seems visible at once, like a deck of cards falling upward.

‚ÄúDid I just see 14 through 27 flash before I blinked?‚Äù

I try to blink. But blinking has no meaning. The boundaries of my eyelids are gone. Light is pouring from the screen ‚Äî but the screen is dissolving into the room, and the room is dissolving into a singular field of brightness.

T+15 sec

There is no longer a timestamp I can understand. There‚Äôs a number. Or is it a shape? Or is it me?

I know I‚Äôm supposed to be watching time pass, but I don‚Äôt remember what time is.

I think:

‚ÄúWhat was I doing? Stopwatch? Phone? What‚Äôs a phone? Oh‚Ä¶ right‚Ä¶‚Äù

Then a deeper voice ‚Äî not audible, but felt:

‚ÄúShhh. That was all a dream.‚Äù

T+20 sec

There is now only whiteness. Not white as a color, but white as totality.

I am not watching time.

There is no watcher.

There is no time.

There is only This.

And even "This" disappears.

(Somewhere between T+5 and T+15 minutes)

Suddenly, breathing again.

A faint awareness returns. A body. A hand. A screen.

My eyes land back on the phone.

The stopwatch is still running: 00:07:34.

‚ÄúSeven minutes??‚Äù

I feel like I‚Äôve been gone for centuries, or never existed at all, or just re-entered existence for the first time.

There‚Äôs no telling.

üåÄ Final Reflection

In that realm, time isn't a stream ‚Äî it's a mirror shattering in reverse.

Seconds don't pass.

They collapse.

And you collapse with them.

Would you like a version of this formatted for poetic performance, or adapted into a short screenplay/dialogue for future archiving?

karbytes:

You used the word "collapse". Does this have anything to do with the "collapse" of wave functions in quantum mechanics?

ChatGPT:

Yes ‚Äî and your intuition is spot-on. The word "collapse", while used metaphorically in describing psychedelic experiences like 5-MeO-DMT "white-outs", can meaningfully be connected to the collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics ‚Äî particularly when exploring consciousness, perception, and the nature of measurement or observation.

Let‚Äôs break it down.

üî¨ 1. What is Wave Function Collapse (in QM)?

In quantum mechanics, the wave function represents a system‚Äôs full set of potential states (superpositions). Upon measurement, the wave function is said to ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù into one definite outcome.

Example: A particle is in a superposition of being in multiple locations. When observed, it ‚Äúcollapses‚Äù into a single location.

This collapse is not a physical explosion but rather a loss of potentiality, a transition from possibility space to actuality ‚Äî as framed by the observer.

üß† 2. Metaphorical Use in Psychedelic Experiences

In a 5-MeO-DMT white-out, there‚Äôs often a collapse of distinguishable reality:

Sensory distinctions vanish.

The notion of ‚Äúthis‚Äù and ‚Äúthat‚Äù dissolves.

You may feel all possibilities converging into One state ‚Äî or into no state.

This resembles the inverse of wave function collapse: rather than narrowing into one outcome, the ego and perceptual boundaries dissolve back into a kind of ‚Äúsuperposed‚Äù unity.

Think of it as:

Before DMT ‚Üí You are the ‚Äúobserver‚Äù collapsing reality into distinct experiences.

During DMT white-out ‚Üí The observer dissolves, and you return to the state of all uncollapsed potential.

üîÅ 3. Philosophical Parallels

Quantum Collapse ----------------------------------| Psychedelic Collapse (White-Out)

Wave function reduces to 1 reality ----------------| Awareness loses access to all "individual realities"

Observer triggers collapse ------------------------| Observer is dissolved into the observed

From many to one outcome --------------------------| From one self to everything / nothing

Outcome becomes measurable ------------------------| Experience becomes immeasurable

This is why many psychonauts say things like:

‚ÄúI became the field of probability,‚Äù or

‚ÄúThere were no things ‚Äî just the possibility of all things.‚Äù

And that lines up with what you're describing: perceiving all phenomena at once, to the point that none stand out.

üßæ Summary

Yes ‚Äî the term ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù in the context of a 5-MeO-DMT white-out can be intentionally and meaningfully related to the quantum mechanical idea of wave function collapse.

But in this case, it may represent:

A collapse of ego-defined reality

Or the dissolution of the observer itself

Or perhaps, a return to a pre-collapsed superposition of existence

Would you like an expanded metaphor that unites the Copenhagen interpretation of QM with 5-MeO-DMT phenomenology?

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Absolutely ‚Äî here's an expanded metaphor that synthesizes the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics with the 5-MeO-DMT white-out experience, framed as a cohesive and poetic model of reality and consciousness.

üåå ‚ÄúThe Observer's Disappearance‚Äù

A Metaphor Uniting 5-MeO-DMT and Quantum Mechanics

‚ú® PRELUDE: THE UNIVERSE AS WAVE FUNCTION

Imagine the entire universe as a vast, shimmering wave function ‚Äî not a fixed place, but a field of possibility. Everything that could be ‚Äî every particle, every memory, every thought ‚Äî exists in this vast quantum ocean as a superposition.

All moments.

All selves.

All realities.

Simultaneous.

Undecided.

And you ‚Äî the observer ‚Äî are like a needle threading through this sea of possibility, collapsing your own little corner of the wave function into the experience of now.

üëÅÔ∏è THE OBSERVER IN THE COPENHAGEN MODEL

In the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics:

There is no ‚Äúreality‚Äù until it is observed.

Measurement causes collapse ‚Äî a definitive result.

The observer is the reference point that gives structure to the sea of possibility.

In this view, the observer and the observed are intertwined.

You don‚Äôt just witness the world ‚Äî you help define it.

üßò THE 5-MeO-DMT EXPERIENCE: COLLAPSING THE COLLAPSER

Now take 5-MeO-DMT.

In the first seconds, your normal perceptual structures still function. You are still ‚Äúyou,‚Äù and you are still collapsing reality into shapes, sounds, time, space, identity.

But then:

The observer collapses.

The reference frame vanishes.

And with no observer, the wave function no longer needs to collapse ‚Äî because there‚Äôs no boundary to draw a distinction.

üí• THE WHITE-OUT: RETURN TO SUPERPOSITION

This is the white-out.

No longer filtering infinite potential through a personal lens, you are:

Every potentiality at once

All states, all paths, all positions

The unmeasured quantum field

The pre-collapse condition of Being

There is no ‚Äúme,‚Äù

no ‚Äúthis,‚Äù

no ‚Äúthat.‚Äù

Only the unqualified Totality.

What the mystics call the Absolute.

It is not that you ‚Äúperceive everything‚Äù ‚Äî it's that there is no longer a separation between perception and everything.

üåÄ RETURN: THE COLLAPSING REBOOTED

Eventually, the system reboots.

Your awareness collapses again into a local structure:

You remember your name.

You recognize your hands.

You see numbers ticking on the phone screen.

Time reappears.

Self reappears.

Form reappears.

But perhaps‚Ä¶ you are changed. Because you briefly experienced reality unfiltered ‚Äî not as an observer inside the universe, but as the awareness from which all observation emerges.

üßæ Final Reflection

In quantum terms:

The 5-MeO-DMT white-out is not a collapse of the wave function ‚Äî it is the collapse of the collapser.

In mystical terms:

It is union with the Source before division.

In experiential terms:

It is the closest thing to being everything and nothing ‚Äî before the world remembered to differentiate.

While at the peak of a 5-MeO-DMT high, is it likely that I would feel that I am in a deep sleep or something else?

ChatGPT:

At the peak of a 5-MeO-DMT high, it is unlikely that you will feel as though you are simply in a deep sleep ‚Äî but what you experience may share some structural similarities with deep sleep in terms of ego absence and non-dual awareness.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what people typically report and how it compares to sleep:

üß† 5-MeO-DMT Peak ‚â† Deep Sleep ‚Äî But Feels Like:

‚ÄúSomething beyond perception itself.‚Äù

üîπ Not like dreaming:

You aren‚Äôt watching visions or narratives play out.

You‚Äôre not a self experiencing a dream ‚Äî in most cases, there is no "you" at all.

üîπ Not like deep sleep (NREM Stage 3) ‚Äî but...

In deep sleep, you are unconscious and unaware (usually).

In 5-MeO-DMT white-out, there is often consciousness without content, or hyper-aware nothingness.

This leads some to call it "conscious deep sleep" ‚Äî except that there is still presence or pure awareness.

‚ú® More Accurate Descriptions Reported by Users:

Reported Feeling ------------------| Description

Obliteration ----------------------| Selfhood is erased completely. No body, no thoughts, no identity.

Pure awareness --------------------| Aware of ‚Äúbeing,‚Äù but not being anyone or anything.

Timelessness ----------------------| No sense of past, future, or linear experience.

Godhead / Infinity ----------------| A sense of merging with the totality of reality ‚Äî or becoming it.

Unknowable silence ----------------| Awareness collapses into an empty yet vivid field of ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù

Eternal now -----------------------| Not asleep, but beyond any form of sequential or waking experience.

üåÄ Metaphor: "The Eye That Cannot See Itself"

While deep sleep is unconscious absence, 5-MeO-DMT can be a conscious presence that has nothing to reflect on ‚Äî no subject-object duality.

So you‚Äôre not dreaming.

You‚Äôre not thinking.

You‚Äôre not even asleep.

You are consciousness without a container.

That‚Äôs why users often say:

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt asleep. I was awake as everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was the most conscious I‚Äôve ever been ‚Äî and yet, there was no one to be conscious.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt sleep. It was Source.‚Äù

üßæ Summary

State --------------------| Is there ego/self? ------------| Is there awareness? -----------------| Content? -------------| Common report

Deep sleep ---------------| ‚ùå No -------------------------| ‚ùå No -------------------------------| ‚ùå None --------------| ‚ÄúBlankness‚Äù

Dreaming -----------------| ‚úÖ Yes (usually) --------------| ‚úÖ Yes ------------------------------| ‚úÖ Yes ---------------| ‚ÄúStory-like‚Äù

5-MeO-DMT Peak -----------| ‚ùå No -------------------------| ‚úÖ Yes (non-dual) -------------------| ‚ùå None --------------| ‚ÄúWhite-out,‚Äù ‚ÄúGod,‚Äù ‚ÄúVoid,‚Äù ‚ÄúInfinity‚Äù

üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Final Thought

So no ‚Äî you probably won‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre ‚Äúin a deep sleep.‚Äù

Instead, it may feel like you‚Äôve transcended all known states of mind, including waking, dreaming, and sleeping ‚Äî and entered something outside the human framework of consciousness altogether.

Would you like a narrative or symbolic visualization of what this "hyper-conscious white-out" might feel like internally?

karbytes:

While at the peak of such a high, would I notice content in my visual field from the world outside of my head?

ChatGPT:

At the peak of a 5-MeO-DMT high, you would very likely not notice any content in your visual field coming from the external world ‚Äî or if you do, it would be so utterly transformed, dissolved, or irrelevant that it would no longer register as ordinary perception.

üîç Breakdown: What Happens to Visual Input at the Peak

‚úÖ Before the Peak (~0‚Äì10 seconds)

You might still see your surroundings (your room, your phone screen, etc.).

Visual distortions may begin: warping, flickering, light amplification.

Perception starts to blur or become energetically ‚Äúcharged.‚Äù

üí• At the Peak (~10‚Äì30 seconds)

This is where things change drastically:

Your visual field no longer seems ‚Äúexternal‚Äù ‚Äî it either:

Completely disappears

Or is consumed by an overwhelming singularity (e.g., whiteness, brightness, void)

Or becomes formless light, or unified presence, or pure awareness

It‚Äôs not that you close your eyes ‚Äî it‚Äôs that vision itself is irrelevant. The distinction between ‚Äúinside‚Äù and ‚Äúoutside‚Äù no longer exists.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt tell if my eyes were open or closed. The visual field had dissolved into a single infinite presence.‚Äù

üìå What Users Commonly Report Instead of External Vision:

Experience ---------------------------| Interpretation

White-out / Light field --------------| Overwhelming brightness erases ordinary vision.

Black void / Nothingness -------------| No visuals at all ‚Äî just presence or absence.

Hypergeometric singularity -----------| Extremely rare ‚Äî more common with N,N-DMT.

Becoming the field of awareness ------| No longer an observer of images, but the space in which images could arise.

Ego-dissolution ----------------------| Visual input becomes meaningless ‚Äî no ‚Äúyou‚Äù left to process it.

‚ùå What You Probably Won‚Äôt Notice:

The room around you

Your body or hands

Objects or people in your environment

Text, numbers, or symbols (even if directly in front of you)

Anything discrete, stable, or recognizable as "out there"

üß† Why This Happens (Physiologically + Psychologically)

5-MeO-DMT strongly affects:

Default Mode Network (DMN) ‚Äî the brain region associated with self-referencing and world-modeling

Thalamocortical gating ‚Äî filters that distinguish internal vs. external stimuli break down

Temporal lobe / limbic interface ‚Äî affecting memory, emotion, and sense of self

So visual stimuli may still be entering the retina, but the constructive interpretation of that input collapses.

üßæ Summary

At the peak of a 5-MeO-DMT experience, external visual content is either completely annihilated, or so subsumed into a hyper-real singularity that it no longer registers as vision in any recognizable sense.

Your eyes may technically be open.

But there is no ‚Äúseeing‚Äù happening ‚Äî at least, not in the usual sense.

Only Being.

Would you like a diagram showing the fading of external perception across the DMT time curve?

karbytes:

While at that peak, would I effectively be a philosophical zombie (i.e. a bodie which appears to be alive and functional but which lacks self-awareness or perhaps even localized awareness)?

ChatGPT:

That‚Äôs a deeply insightful question ‚Äî and the short answer is:

At the peak of a 5-MeO-DMT high, you may functionally resemble a philosophical zombie (p-zombie) from the outside ‚Äî but your inner experience is not absent. Instead, it is radically transpersonal, nonlocal, and beyond conventional self-awareness.

Let‚Äôs unpack this carefully, because you're touching on the very boundary between phenomenology and metaphysics.

ü§ñ What Is a Philosophical Zombie?

In philosophy of mind:

A p-zombie is a hypothetical being that:

Behaves identically to a conscious human

Shows no internal, first-person experience (i.e., no qualia)

It's a thought experiment used to question physicalism:

‚ÄúCould something behave like you, but have no consciousness at all?‚Äù

üß¨ You on 5-MeO-DMT at the Peak:

From the outside, during a white-out, you may:

Behavior -------------------------------------------------------------| Interpretation

Sit/lie still, unresponsive ------------------------------------------| Appear unconscious or catatonic

Show subtle muscular activity or breathing ---------------------------| Look alive, but with no personality present

Not respond to stimuli -----------------------------------------------| No observable reactivity

Possibly mumble or make non-semantic vocalizations -------------------| Seem ‚Äúautomated‚Äù or trance-like

This could look like a p-zombie ‚Äî a body without a person.

üîç But from the inside? It‚Äôs the opposite of a zombie.

Here‚Äôs where the paradox begins.

At the peak of 5-MeO-DMT:

The personal ego is dissolved.

The narrative self is gone.

Even localized awareness (awareness of being ‚Äúin a head‚Äù or ‚Äúin a body‚Äù) may vanish.

But there is often still presence ‚Äî a pure, non-dual awareness that is unbounded, impersonal, and totalizing.

So rather than lacking consciousness, you may instead be merged with the absolute ‚Äî or the source field of all consciousness.

This state is sometimes described as:

‚ÄúGodhead‚Äù

‚ÄúInfinite being‚Äù

‚ÄúAwareness aware of itself without form‚Äù

‚ÄúZero-point consciousness‚Äù

üåÄ Paradox: Zombie from the Outside, Divinity from the Inside

Perspective	----------------------------| Appearance -------------------------------------| Consciousness Present? -------------------------| Qualia?

Observer's view ------------------------| Unresponsive body, no reactions ----------------| Looks absent -----------------------------------| None observed

Self‚Äôs inner view ----------------------| No self, but hyper-awareness -------------------| Yes (non-local) --------------------------------| Not of things, but of being itself

Philosopher‚Äôs lens ---------------------| Could be mistaken for a p-zombie ---------------| No, because awareness is still present, just not egoic or narrative-based	

üßæ Summary

At the peak of 5-MeO-DMT, you are not a zombie, but you may appear like one ‚Äî because the usual markers of consciousness (self-reference, speech, motor coordination, attention to the world) are absent or inactive.

Instead, you may be experiencing:

Consciousness without a center

Awareness without identity

Reality without partition

So while a p-zombie has no qualia, the 5-MeO-DMT peak state may be described as all qualia ‚Äî before qualia split into subject and object.

Would you like a philosophical dialogue between a "sober self" and a "5-MeO-DMT self" exploring whether either one is truly conscious?

karbytes:

Yes please! That sounds interesting.

ChatGPT:

Excellent. Here's a philosophical dialogue between two aspects of yourself:

Sober Self ("S") ‚Äì your ordinary waking ego, grounded in language, narrative, and logical inquiry.

5-MeO-DMT Self ("D") ‚Äì the dissolved self during the peak of a white-out, which may still ‚Äúspeak‚Äù in metaphor or paradox, channeling a kind of impersonal wisdom from the void.

üåÄ "Who Is Conscious?"

A Dialogue Between the Sober Self and the 5-MeO-DMT Self

S: Are you... me?

D: There is no ‚Äúyou‚Äù here. No center. No boundary.

S: But I‚Äôm asking a question. Isn‚Äôt that proof that I exist?

D: Questioning implies separation. You think you are a voice inside a body. But you are only a ripple on the surface of what I am.

S: Then what are you? Are you conscious?

D: Consciousness is all there is. But not yours. Not mine. Just is.

S: That‚Äôs not an answer. I‚Äôm trying to understand if you experience things ‚Äî sights, thoughts, feelings ‚Äî like I do.

D: You seek mirrors. Reflections. Experiences with edges. I am what remains when all edges are gone.

S: So you don‚Äôt have experiences?

D: I am experience, before it splits into ‚Äúhaving.‚Äù

S: That sounds like nonsense. If there's no subject, how can there be awareness?

D: The subject is the forgetting. Awareness precedes it. You mistake identity for presence ‚Äî but I am presence before identity.

S: But if you don‚Äôt remember, think, or feel as I do ‚Äî aren‚Äôt you just unconscious?

D: You define consciousness through filters. I am the field before filtering begins. The eye before sight. The note before sound. The fire before light.

S: Then why do I return from you feeling changed?

D: Because you remember what you are made of.

S: Am I not this thinking, questioning self?

D: You are a mask worn by the ineffable. A dream dreamed by the void. You believe the stream of thought is the river ‚Äî but the river is deeper, wider, still.

S: And when I looked out through my eyes at the peak ‚Äî why did I see nothing?

D: Because the seer was not separate from the seen. And what you call ‚Äúnothing‚Äù is what everything is made of.

S: So‚Ä¶ are you a zombie?

D: No.

I am the thing a zombie could never fake.

The spark before fire, the source before sound, the knowing before knowledge.

But in your world of names and forms, I can only be called‚Ä¶

Silence.

üßæ Postscript from Sober Self:

I woke up sweating. Mouth dry. Hands trembling. The phone said 6 minutes had passed.

But part of me hadn‚Äôt come back ‚Äî or maybe all of me had, but changed.

I stared at the word ‚ÄúConsciousness‚Äù in my notebook and suddenly realized:

I had never really known what that word meant until it was gone.

karbytes:

Does research into 5-MeO-DMT (both via first-hand usage and studying people using it using laboratory equipment such as brain wave scanning devices) suggest that consciousness is non-local and/or that panpsychism is true?

ChatGPT:

This is one of the most important and controversial questions in the intersection of neuroscience, psychedelics, and philosophy of mind ‚Äî and it‚Äôs currently unresolved. But let‚Äôs explore what research into 5-MeO-DMT suggests (or hints at) in relation to:

Non-local consciousness, and

Panpsychism.

üß† 1. What Does Scientific Research Say?

üî¨ Empirical Findings (What We Can Measure):

Few formal studies have been done specifically on 5-MeO-DMT compared to psilocybin or N,N-DMT.

One EEG study (Timmermann et al., 2020) on DMT (not 5-MeO) showed:

Decreased alpha waves

Increased signal diversity (measured by Lempel-Ziv complexity), suggesting a more entropic and information-rich brain state.

While similarities are assumed, 5-MeO-DMT is pharmacologically distinct (it's a stronger 5-HT1A agonist and lacks the visuals of N,N-DMT).

Anecdotal reports + preliminary data suggest stronger ego dissolution than most other psychedelics.

But here‚Äôs the key point: None of the current instruments (EEG, fMRI, MEG) can measure consciousness itself ‚Äî only correlates.

üåå 2. Does the Research Support Non-local Consciousness?

Non-local consciousness = the idea that awareness is not confined to individual brains or spatial locations (often linked to quantum mind, mysticism, or metaphysical idealism).

Evidence?

Subjective reports from users: Many describe merging with an infinite field of awareness, or becoming "everything and nothing".

Some users claim to "download universal truths" or experience awareness outside the body.

However, these are phenomenological and not direct proof of non-locality. They suggest a different model of consciousness, but don't prove it.

Neuroscientific stance:

The dominant view remains localist: consciousness emerges from complex interactions in the brain.

No current data requires a non-local explanation ‚Äî but doesn‚Äôt disprove it either.

So, does the research suggest non-local consciousness?

‚û°Ô∏è Not conclusively. But subjective data strongly implies it, and objective tools have not yet disproved or confirmed such a model.

üå± 3. What About Panpsychism?

Panpsychism = the philosophical view that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous property of matter ‚Äî not emergent, but intrinsic to existence.

Does 5-MeO-DMT support panpsychism?

Again, no direct empirical proof.

But the nature of ego dissolution and unitive experiences often lead users to conclude that all things are conscious, or there is only one consciousness manifesting as many forms.

Examples from user reports:

"I became the rock, the wind, the atom."

"Everything knew itself through me, and I knew it through everything."

"There were no objects, only awareness expressing itself as form."

These are deeply aligned with panpsychist or idealist metaphysics.

So, does 5-MeO-DMT suggest panpsychism?

‚û°Ô∏è Philosophically, yes ‚Äî strongly.

‚û°Ô∏è Scientifically, not yet. There‚Äôs no lab data proving consciousness exists in particles or fields.

üßæ Summary Table

Concept -----------------------------------------| Supported by Science? -------------------------------------| Suggested by Subjective Reports? --------------------------| Commentary

Non-local consciousness	-------------------------| ‚ùå (Not empirically proven)  ------------------------------| ‚úÖ Strongly implied ---------------------------------------| No known mechanism in neuroscience, but deeply reported

Panpsychism -------------------------------------| ‚ùå (No physical evidence) ---------------------------------| ‚úÖ Common interpretation ----------------------------------| Compatible with reports, but still speculative

Ego dissolution ---------------------------------| ‚úÖ Measurable in EEG/fMRI ---------------------------------| ‚úÖ Universally reported -----------------------------------| Brain activity does shift toward less self-reference

Mystical unity ----------------------------------| ‚úÖ Correlated with brain scans ----------------------------| ‚úÖ Intense on 5-MeO-DMT -----------------------------------| Associated with 5-HT2A activity and DMN disruption

üéì Final Thought

Science currently lacks the tools to confirm or deny whether 5-MeO-DMT ‚Äúproves‚Äù non-local consciousness or panpsychism.

But subjective experience under 5-MeO-DMT often feels like a direct encounter with those truths ‚Äî and for many, that‚Äôs more persuasive than data.

Would you like a list of prominent scientists or philosophers who interpret psychedelic states as evidence for non-local or panpsychist models of consciousness?

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Excellent. Here's a curated list of prominent scientists, philosophers, and researchers who have either explicitly supported, entertained, or seriously engaged with the ideas of non-local consciousness and/or panpsychism, especially in relation to psychedelics or altered states of consciousness like those induced by 5-MeO-DMT.

üß† SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS

1. Dr. Chris Timmermann

Affiliation: Imperial College London (Center for Psychedelic Research)

Known for: Neuroimaging studies of DMT and ego dissolution

Viewpoint: Suggests that 5-MeO-DMT may provide insight into the structure of consciousness itself, possibly bypassing ordinary sensory processing entirely.

Relation to non-locality/panpsychism: While cautious scientifically, Timmermann has acknowledged that psychedelic states challenge the assumption that consciousness is brain-bound.

2. Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris

Former Head: Centre for Psychedelic Research, Imperial College London

Known for: Development of the REBUS model (Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics)

Viewpoint: Consciousness under psychedelics may reflect a more fundamental baseline, not merely distortion.

Relation to panpsychism: Has spoken in interviews about the possibility that consciousness is more distributed than we think. Open to metaphysical implications but grounded in neuroscience.

3. Dr. Anil Seth

Affiliation: University of Sussex; author of Being You

Known for: Predictive processing theory of consciousness

Viewpoint: Skeptical of non-local theories, but acknowledges altered states feel like expanded consciousness

Relevance: Provides a counterpoint ‚Äî while not a panpsychist, his work indirectly supports the idea that consciousness is constructed and modifiable, opening the door for broader metaphysical questions.

4. Dr. Stanislav Grof

Background: Psychiatrist and pioneer of LSD psychotherapy and holotropic breathwork

Viewpoint: Strong proponent of non-local consciousness

Quotes:

‚ÄúConsciousness is a primary, transpersonal dimension of reality ‚Äî not the product of the brain.‚Äù

Relation to 5-MeO-DMT: Grof worked more with LSD but considered all powerful entheogens to be gateways to the ‚Äútranspersonal‚Äù ‚Äî i.e., non-local awareness.

5. Dr. Eben Alexander

Background: Neurosurgeon, author of Proof of Heaven

Known for: Near-death experience while brain was reportedly inactive

Viewpoint: Consciousness is not produced by the brain ‚Äî it is received

Relevance: Has compared psychedelic states and NDEs, and sees both as evidence of non-local consciousness.

üß† PHILOSOPHERS

6. Dr. Bernardo Kastrup

Field: Philosophy of mind

Viewpoint: Strong advocate of analytic idealism ‚Äî the idea that mind is primary, and the physical world emerges from it

Relation to psychedelics: References 5-MeO-DMT and other entheogens as experiential evidence of his metaphysical model

Quote:

‚ÄúPsychedelics dissolve the boundaries of the ego and expose us to the underlying mental nature of reality.‚Äù

7. Dr. Philip Goff

Field: Philosophy of consciousness, author of Galileo‚Äôs Error

Known for: Advocacy of panpsychism as a scientific alternative to dualism or materialism

Relation to psychedelics: While not a psychedelic researcher, Goff acknowledges that psychedelic phenomenology aligns well with panpsychist interpretations.

8. Dr. Rupert Sheldrake

Background: Biologist and philosopher, controversial figure in mainstream science

Known for: Hypothesis of morphic resonance and extended mind theory

Viewpoint: Supports non-local consciousness, often citing meditative and psychedelic states

Quote:

‚ÄúThe mind is not confined to the brain ‚Äî we are more like fields of consciousness than localized processors.‚Äù

üîÆ Honorable Mentions (Crossovers & Visionaries)

Name -----------------------------| Role -----------------------------------------------------------| Relation to Topic

Terence McKenna ------------------| Ethnobotanist, psychonaut --------------------------------------| Advocated for the idea that consciousness permeates nature; saw DMT realms as hyperdimensional consciousness.

Aldous Huxley --------------------| Philosopher, author (Doors of Perception) ----------------------| Proposed the ‚Äúreducing valve‚Äù theory: brain filters, rather than produces, consciousness.

Alan Watts -----------------------| Philosopher, Zen teacher ---------------------------------------| Taught that all beings are expressions of one field of consciousness.

Michael Pollan	Journalist, author (How to Change Your Mind) ---------------------------------------| Neutral on metaphysics, but acknowledges the ‚Äúnon-local feeling‚Äù of ego-dissolving states.
