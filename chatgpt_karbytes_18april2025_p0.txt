The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o which took place between the hours of 2:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 16_APRIL_2025 and 7:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 16_APRIL_2025. The conversation pertains to karbytes' use of glass dildos to gradually train karbytes' vagina (and, to a secondary extent, karbytes' anus) to comfortably accept being penetrated by incrementally larger dildos (which is a practice karbytes values (a)for developing a deeper understanding and awareness of how karbytes' mind and karbytes' body are connected (and karbytes can verify that karbytes' thinking stressful thoughts almost instantly cause karbytes' vagina to become drier and tighter), (b) as a means for experiencing "naturalistic" pleasure, and (c) for preventing karbytes' vagina and pelvic floor tissues from atrophying (especially as a consequence of having "unnaturally" lowered estrogen levels due to karbytes injecting itself intramuscularly with physician-prescribed testosterone cypianate as part of karbytes' preferred gender expression)).

How long does it take to move up in dilator size when using different sized dildos vaginally?

ChatGPT:

The time it takes to move up in dilator size (or different-sized dildos used for therapeutic vaginal dilation) varies greatly depending on individual anatomy, goals, comfort, and any underlying medical or psychological conditions. However, here are some general guidelines:

General Timeline (Average Ranges):

Initial Adjustment:

- Moving from no penetration or very small size (e.g., pinky-sized) to a small dilator (around 1-1.5 cm diameter) can take a few days to a couple of weeks of consistent practice.

Subsequent Size Increases:

- Each next size might take 1–4 weeks of regular use (3–5 times per week, 10–30 minutes per session) before moving up.

Full Progression (e.g., 4–5 sizes):

- Reaching a "standard" vaginal intercourse size (approximately 1.5–2 inches in diameter, 5–6 inches length) might take anywhere from 1–6 months, depending on consistency, physical comfort, and emotional factors.

Factors Affecting Progress:

- Consistency: Daily or near-daily sessions tend to produce the most progress.

- Duration: Sessions of 10–30 minutes help with tissue elasticity.

- Relaxation & Lubrication: Essential to reduce discomfort and encourage progress.

- Pelvic Floor Tension or Vaginismus: May require pelvic floor physical therapy and take longer.

- Hormonal Status: Estrogen levels (low post-menopause or from hormone therapy) can affect vaginal tissue flexibility.

- Medical Guidance: Working with a gynecologist, physical therapist, or sex therapist can accelerate progress and prevent injury.

Tips for Success:

- Warm-up: A hot bath or relaxation exercises can help.

- Breathing: Deep diaphragmatic breathing helps reduce pelvic floor guarding.

- Mind-body connection: Avoid forcing progress; gentle persistence is more effective.

- Journal or Track: Logging your experience helps identify patterns or emotional blocks.

karbytes:

I'm using glass dildos which are each straight and 9 inches long but with different diameters. The one I'm currently comfortable with has a diameter of 1.37 inches (and I was able to insert the one with a diameter of 1.57 inches but with significant discomfort (which caused me to want to take it out after just a few minutes)). The other of such dildos have diameters of 1.77 inches and 1.97 inches.

Thanks for the detailed info—your current setup gives a good baseline for pacing progress.

Suggested Progression Plan Based on Your Current Comfort Levels:

Current Comfort Zone:

- 1.37 inch diameter: Use this as your warm-up and baseline tool.

- Aim for 15–30 minute sessions, 3–5 times per week.

Next Size (1.57 inch):

- Since this one caused significant discomfort, the key is gradual desensitization.

- Use it after warming up with the 1.37" for at least 10 minutes.

- Start with short sessions (e.g., 1–3 minutes), even just partial insertion if needed.

- Increase by 1–2 minutes every few days, only if there's no lasting pain.

- Expect this phase to take 2–4 weeks, possibly more.

Following Sizes (1.77 and 1.97 inches):

- Once 1.57” is consistently comfortable for 15–20+ minutes:

- Introduce 1.77” the same way: start slow, use as follow-up to 1.57”.

- Progress through 1.77” may take 3–6 weeks.

- Only attempt 1.97” once 1.77” is consistently tolerable.

- That final jump may require 4–8 weeks depending on tissue elasticity and psychological comfort.

Additional Tips:

- Generous lube: Water-based or silicone-based can help reduce friction.

- Body position: Side-lying or squatting might make insertion easier.

- Breathing and focus: Stay relaxed; consider guided meditations or calming music.

- Track progress: Not just by time or diameter, but how your body feels the next day (any soreness, tightness, etc.).
