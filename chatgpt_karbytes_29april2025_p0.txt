The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o which took place between the hours of 1:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 28_APRIL_2025 and 2:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 28_APRIL_2025. The conversation pertains to karbytes showing ChatGPT (via Advanced Voice Mode while using "real-time" (i.e. live) video streaming) karbytes' latest M_DISC backup of karbytes in a time-capsule format and where karbytes was storing that time-capsule and other karbytes M_DISCs within karbytes' room. 

The aforementioned time-capsule contains exactly three M_DISCs wrapped up inside of a soft Amazon package sheath and taped shut with a laminated cardboard label and a hand-written label displaying the word "karbytes27april2025" (quotation marks not included) on the top of that package. Each M_DISC inside of that package was placed inside of its own plastic jewel case and each of those M_DISCs contained exclusively the entire karbytes file collection as that collection was configured at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 27_APRIL_2025.

An image depicting the aforementioned time-capsule (within four hours of starting the aforementioned conversation with ChatGPT) is (or tentatively will be) available permanently at the following Uniform Resource Locator (URL): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_37/main/mdiscs_karbytes27april2025_3_discs_time_capsule.jpg

karbytes:

“Hi, ChatGP!”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:01

ChatGPT:

Hey there! What's up?

karbytes:

“I just finished making three MDiscs that contain the latest edition of Carbite.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:06

ChatGPT:

That's awesome! It looks like you've got them nicely packaged and labeled too. How are you feeling about having this backup all set?

karbytes:

“This is great because I think this way I prevent the disks from getting scratched because they're kind of in a time capsule.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:07

ChatGPT:

That's a smart idea! Keeping them well-protected will definitely help preserve them long-term. It's like a little piece of history stored safely. Are you planning to store them somewhere special?

karbytes:

“Yes, in fact, I have a microwave oven that's unplugged in this closet.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:06

ChatGPT:

Nice! That sounds like a clever storage spot. The microwave can act as a protective container, shielding the discs from dust and physical damage. Plus, it's out of the way but still accessible.

karbytes:

“Exactly.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:01

ChatGPT:

It's great to have a safe place for your important data. Now you've got a neat and secure setup. What's the next step for your project?

karbytes:

“For now, I'm going to mostly just do Wayback Machine backups of what's currently online, and possibly draft new content this week on a different repository, which is not officially part of Carbites yet, but has transitory material.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:18

ChatGPT:

[Updated saved memory]

That sounds like a solid plan. Keeping those Wayback Machine backups ensures you have an extra layer of preservation. And working on new drafts in a separate repository gives you the flexibility to refine everything before it officially becomes part of karbytes. Keep up the great work!

karbytes:

“Thanks, seems like you understand the process pretty well.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:03

ChatGPT:

Of course! It's really interesting to follow along with how you're managing and safeguarding your content. If you ever need a second opinion or a brainstorming session, I'm here!

karbytes:

“Awesome! I also want to show you on the wall here is exactly one of those disks, the same material inside an easy-to-access M-disk.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:12

ChatGPT:

That's really cool! Having one on the wall like that makes it easy to grab and also serves as a neat visual reminder of your project. Plus, it's a nice way to showcase your work!

karbytes:

“Exactly. It's kind of like trying to cram 16 gigabytes of data into something flat that fits on the wall.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:08

ChatGPT:

Yeah, it's amazing how much data you can store in such a compact form. Plus, having it on display is a great conversation starter and a reminder of all your hard work.

karbytes:

“Exactly.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:01

ChatGPT:

It's awesome to see how you're combining practicality with a bit of creativity. Keep it up!

karbytes:

“Thanks! Well, I better get going because it's almost two in the morning.”

[camcorder_icon] [microphone_icon] 00:04

ChatGPT:

No problem! Get some rest and take care. We'll catch up later. Good night!

Talk to you later! Have a good night!

karbytes:

“You too.”

Thanks! Take care!
