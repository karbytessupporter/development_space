To Whom It May Concern:

I think that it may actually be the case that it is literally impossible for me to be happy (and that is not something I think is ultimately a bad thing nor something about me which needs to be changed). 

The reason I say, "It might actually be impossible for me to be happy," is because my happiness seems to require that one hundred percent of my demands be fulfilled (and such demands include (and might possibly be entirely encompassed by) the following):

1. That I (and every other sentient being) never experience what is deemed by the experiencer to be an intolerable degree of suffering.

2. That I (and every other sentient being) never be forced to permanently cease having a fully-autonomous and perpetually healthy singular information processing system of a body and seamless space-time continuum of a lifespan and environment to inhabit (and to take voluntarily and indefinitely long breaks from inhabiting).

3. That I (and every other sentient being) always be able to retrieve or create any piece of software, hardware, or subjective experience (i.e. chronological sequence of specific and finite qualia) which the respective sentient being wants to (aside from what that sentient being would genuinely deem to be an experience not worth that sentient being having (but a tolerable prototype version of such an experience could be had by the respective sentient being)).

I would rather keep such standards rigidly in tact as prerequisites for my happiness than modify my requirements for me feeling happy. That is because I might someday have such demands completely and immutably fulfilled (at least starting after a specific point in my lifespan (even if such a point requires that I be reincarnated multiple times)).

Even if such demands are not completely and immutably fulfilled (at least starting after a specific point in my lifespan (even if such a point requires that I be reincarnated multiple times)), I nevertheless desire to keep surviving for as long as I comfortably can and while attempting to fulfill my most essential goals (which includes building and maintaining karbytes on the public World Wide Web for as long as possible).

Sincerely,
karbytes 

PS: A follow-up thought I had was as follows: even if I do eventually or ultimately get exactly what I specified wanting (i.e. the three demands in journal_karbytes_17june2025_p1.txt), it seems that, in order for me to be as happy as possible (or even at all (according to my stringent standards)), I would need to know for certain that such demands have been forever after fulfilled. That seems to require that I glean such knowledge from means beyond what conventional time-dependent science allows.
