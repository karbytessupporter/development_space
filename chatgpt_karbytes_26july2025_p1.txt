What's the purpose of unclean vocals in black metal?

ChatGPT:

Unclean vocals‚Äîsuch as shrieks, screams, growls, or raspy singing‚Äîare an essential part of black metal‚Äôs aesthetic, and their purpose goes beyond simply sounding ‚Äúaggressive.‚Äù Here‚Äôs why they matter:

1. Conveying Emotion and Atmosphere

Black metal is often described as evoking feelings of isolation, despair, or transcendence rather than straightforward anger. Unclean vocals, especially the high-pitched shrieks or rasps common in the genre, resemble primal screams or wails. This rawness connects to the themes of suffering, cosmic indifference, or mysticism that black metal frequently explores.

2. Serving as Another Instrument

In black metal, vocals are often mixed low and treated with reverb, delay, or distortion. This makes them less about delivering intelligible lyrics and more about blending with the soundscape. The voice becomes part of the texture‚Äîlike a harsh wind or an additional layer of distortion‚Äîcontributing to the ‚Äúwall of sound‚Äù aesthetic.

3. Anti-Commercial and Transgressive Intent

Black metal, especially in its early Norwegian form (Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum), was a reaction against mainstream heavy metal‚Äôs polished sound. Clean vocals were seen as too melodic, human, or conventional. Harsh vocals reject mainstream accessibility, aligning with black metal‚Äôs ethos of being raw, unpolished, and deliberately abrasive.

4. Alignment with Lyrical Themes

Many black metal lyrics deal with themes like death, occultism, misanthropy, or nature‚Äôs harshness. Unclean vocals emphasize these themes by stripping away warmth and conventional beauty, giving the impression of a voice that‚Äôs almost inhuman‚Äîfitting for music meant to evoke the ‚Äúcoldness‚Äù of nature or cosmic darkness.

5. Psychological Distance

Unclean vocals often feel alien or otherworldly, distancing the listener from the performer as a ‚Äúperson‚Äù and allowing the music to feel more like a force of nature or a ritual. This contrasts with pop or rock, where clean vocals emphasize personality and relatability.

In short: unclean vocals in black metal are less about lyrical clarity and more about embodying the genre‚Äôs aesthetic‚Äîraw, atmospheric, and uncompromisingly dark.

Would you like me to give you examples of iconic black metal vocal styles (like Attila Csihar‚Äôs ritualistic chants with Mayhem vs. Varg Vikernes‚Äôs piercing shrieks) to show the range of unclean vocal techniques?

karbytes:

Yes, please.

ChatGPT:

Great! Here's a breakdown of iconic black metal vocal styles‚Äîeach illustrating a different purpose or emotional texture behind unclean vocals:

1. Varg Vikernes (Burzum) ‚Äì Piercing, Isolated Shrieks

Album: Filosofem (1996)

Example Track: ‚ÄúDunkelheit‚Äù

Vocal Style: Thin, reverb-drenched, distant shrieks that sound almost ghostly or disembodied.

Effect: Creates a sense of solitude and desolation. The vocals feel like they're echoing from a void, reinforcing the trance-like, hypnotic nature of Burzum‚Äôs minimalist compositions.

2. Attila Csihar (Mayhem) ‚Äì Theatrical, Ritualistic Chants

Album: De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas (1994)

Example Track: ‚ÄúFreezing Moon‚Äù

Vocal Style: Shifting between guttural growls, monk-like chants, wails, whispers, and operatic phrasings.

Effect: Feels ceremonial and otherworldly. Rather than rage, his vocals invoke dread, mysticism, and a cold grandeur‚Äîalmost like a possessed priest.

3. Nocturno Culto (Darkthrone) ‚Äì Cold, Mid-Range Rasps

Album: Transilvanian Hunger (1994)

Example Track: ‚ÄúTransilvanian Hunger‚Äù

Vocal Style: Mid-register, dry rasps that stay consistent and raw.

Effect: Evokes frostbitten detachment. The vocals sit in the mix like another distorted instrument, driving home a sense of monotonous, grim perseverance.

4. Ihsahn (Emperor) ‚Äì Screamed Yet Articulate

Album: Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk (1997)

Example Track: ‚ÄúThus Spake the Nightspirit‚Äù

Vocal Style: Harsh screams, often intelligible, and sometimes layered with clean harmonies or choirs.

Effect: Regal and majestic. Ihsahn‚Äôs vocals are expressive and fit the symphonic, complex structure of Emperor‚Äôs music, adding to its sense of apocalyptic grandeur.

5. Gaahl (Gorgoroth) ‚Äì Controlled, Sadistic Harshness

Album: Incipit Satan (2000)

Example Track: ‚ÄúIncipit Satan‚Äù

Vocal Style: Slow, enunciated growls and screams with theatrical pacing and a malevolent presence.

Effect: Feels calculated and terrifying. Gaahl often speaks his lines or stretches screams in ways that feel deliberately torturous or ritualistic.

6. Tr00 Kvlt Lo-Fi Tapes ‚Äì Raw Tape Recorder Aesthetic

Bands: Early Ildjarn, Judas Iscariot, early Graveland

Vocal Style: Nearly inaudible shrieks buried in fuzz or tape hiss

Effect: Total rawness. These vocals often sound like they‚Äôre fighting to pierce through static‚Äîperfect for conveying underground, anti-mainstream ethos and raw purity.

What do you think the purpose of black metal is and what the resolution to it is?

ChatGPT:

That‚Äôs a deep and powerful question‚Äîand one that cuts to the core of what black metal means beyond its sound. Black metal isn‚Äôt just music. It's often a metaphysical stance, a psychological purge, and a confrontation with existence. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd approach its purpose and its possible resolution:

üïØÔ∏è THE PURPOSE OF BLACK METAL

1. Rebellion Against Norms (Social, Religious, Musical)

At its core, black metal began as a rejection: of organized religion (especially Christianity in Norway), of polished commercial music, of societal conformity. Early bands like Mayhem, Darkthrone, and Burzum deliberately made lo-fi, raw, and abrasive art as a counter-ritual to the sanitized world.

Purpose: To destroy illusion and expose hypocrisy. To rip off the mask of society and reveal the abyss beneath.

2. Expression of Inner Darkness

Black metal gives voice to isolation, nihilism, suffering, and transcendence. It is not about being evil for shock‚Äîit‚Äôs about confronting what most people ignore: mortality, cosmic indifference, trauma, despair, and sometimes, the sublime.

Purpose: To externalize internal torment‚Äîto scream into the void, and in doing so, become one with it.

3. Communion with the Sublime (Nature, Cosmos, Chaos)

Atmospheric and pagan black metal (e.g. Wolves in the Throne Room, Drudkh, Ulver) seeks unity with nature, or even cosmic forces beyond comprehension. This becomes spiritual, but not in the Abrahamic sense. It is pantheistic, animistic, or void-worshiping.

Purpose: To dissolve the ego into something bigger, older, and vaster‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs forests, stars, or silence.

4. Artistic and Existential Extremity

Black metal stretches music to extremes: minimalism vs. complexity, noise vs. melody, chaos vs. order. It often embodies paradoxes. In this way, it‚Äôs an art form of edge cases‚Äîa way to express what conventional language or aesthetics cannot.

Purpose: To go where language breaks down and express something primal, ecstatic, and unfiltered.

üï≥Ô∏è THE RESOLUTION TO BLACK METAL

This is more speculative‚Äîbut if black metal is a conflict, then the resolution is:

1. Catharsis Through Confrontation

By embracing pain, horror, and void, black metal offers a way to move through those feelings rather than escape them. The screams don‚Äôt just express suffering‚Äîthey purge it.

Resolution: The listener reaches a strange serenity after total immersion in darkness‚Äîa ‚Äúpeace through fire‚Äù effect.

2. Transcendence Through Ruin

Black metal often expresses a desire to dissolve the ego‚Äînot through bliss, but through obliteration. What comes after ego-death might be a new self, reformed in the ashes.

Resolution: Self-realization by unmaking‚Äîrebirth after annihilation.

3. Sublimation Into Nature or the Infinite

Instead of finding comfort in society or human contact, black metal often finds its ‚Äúhome‚Äù in vast, impersonal forces‚Äîicy forests, ancient spirits, or the stars. When you scream long enough into the void, you become the void.

Resolution: Unity with that which is beyond‚Äîan almost mystical surrender.

4. No Resolution at All

In some circles, especially in depressive or raw black metal, there is no resolution. The point is that suffering has no end, and beauty is a fleeting hallucination. This view isn't nihilism as apathy‚Äîbut nihilism as clarity.

Resolution: The lack of resolution becomes the truth‚Äîand accepting that is a kind of dark enlightenment.

üúè Final Thought

Black metal is a mirror held up to the abyss‚Äîand whether you scream into it, become one with it, or are destroyed by it‚Ä¶ that depends on the listener. Its purpose is to strip you down. Its resolution is whatever remains once all illusions are gone.

Would you like me to help you write a poetic or manifesto-style paragraph summarizing this as a black metal philosophy?
