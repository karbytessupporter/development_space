To Whom It May Concern:

I claim that I am significantly more likely to commit suicide before I ever commit homicide (especially as a means of preventing myself from committing homicide (or some other heinous act against some person other than myself or even to myself)). Though I have yet to have ever felt genuinely suicidal, I anticipate that, perhaps someday in the future, I will ultimately conclude that the best way for me to minimize further suffering is to voluntarily end my own life (hopefully using a means which is quick, painless, and does not cause people other than myself injury or property damage).

Though I do (presently) hold onto hope that (eventually) every living human being will be granted access to what I consider to be a decent standard of living (and the legal right to end their lives via physician assisted suicide for any reason and with minimal delay), I also (presently) feel an undeniable sense of dread that there either are not enough material resources available to enable every living human being (or soon to be born human being) to enjoy what I think is a decent standard of living or else such resources are being hoarded by a relatively small subset of the global human population such that not every human who is currently alive (or soon to be born) has access to what I consider to be a decent standard of living.

An implication of what I said in the previous paragraph is that some people are simply going to be deprived of what they need to enjoy what I think is a decent standard of living and, if the population-to-resource-availability ratio exceeds a certain threshold, some human beings (namely the lowest-ranking in the social hierarchy) will be killed either through unintentional neglect or through more deliberate means of eradication.

Because I seem to be a relatively low-ranking individual with fewer allies than what is deemed to be normal (largely by my own choice to be relatively solitary), I am probably more likely than most other people are to be killed in such a manner. If I think that my chances of suffering beyond what I think is "worthwhile" is sufficiently high, I will most likely attempt to end my own life (of course in a manner which nets as little damage as possible to the human population at large).

Sincerely,

Karlina Ray Beringer (a.k.a. karbytes)
