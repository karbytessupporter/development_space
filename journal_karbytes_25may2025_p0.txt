After doing some research online about various ways physical property is transferred from a deceased (or soon to be deceased) owner of that property to some other person (or organization), I concluded that the M_DISCs I want to preserve following my death and which contain backups of the karbytes file collection are not items which museums nor individuals other than myself would want to acquire. 

Rather than leave those discs to be dealt with by whoever clears out whatever belongings I leave behind wherever I am living, I decided that the most feasible and secure means of preserving those M_DISCs is putting them inside of an air-tight metal time capsule and burrying it in the ground somewhere relatively remote and part of a wilderness preserve (i.e. a region which the government basically owns and has forbidden converting into housing or commercial locations).

Before I bury an M_DISC collection somewhere, I will make a blog post about it on karbytes which specifies the longitude and latitude coordinates of the time capsule burial site (in Planet Earth's lithosphere). I plan to do that within the next thirty years (and I am likely to make my first karbytes time capsule some time within the next five years as soon as I scope out a decent burial site and obtain a suitable container to put my M_DISCs in)).

To avoid making the burial site stand out from the environment around it (i.e. to make it as hidden as possible (aside from disclosing its location in a blog post), I do not plan on placing any special markers near the time capsule. That is to prevent vandals from tampering with the time capsule. I think that people who read my blog and that particular blog post announcing a particular karbytes time capsule burial are likely to honor my wishes to leave that time capsule alone (unless they work for a museum and think that what I have created is worthy of being permanently included in that museum's collection of historical artifacts from human civilization). 

Of course, an M_DISC is not designed to last more than approximately one thousand years. If and when superior archival-quality digital storage media become available to hobbyists such as myself, I will use those new and improved storage media in place of M_DISCs. Even if the time capsules I bury only contain M_DISCs, I have some peace of mind knowing that at least karbytes in solid-state form is in a relatively safe and undisturbed location for at least a few hundred years (and likely hundreds of years after my death).
