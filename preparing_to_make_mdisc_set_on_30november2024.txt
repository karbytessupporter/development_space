To Whom It May Concern:

karbytes is in the process of burning three M_DISCs which each have the same data contents burned to them.

Those data contents consist of, at minimum, all of the zip files which are enumerated on the following web page in the folder named mdisc_karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_19 (i.e. disc 5 of 5):

A single unwritten 4.7 gigabyte M_DISC has a data storage capacity sufficient to store the 14 zip files which comprise the aforementioned folder named mdisc_karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_19 (or else exactly one of the other five M_DISC folders whose zip file contents are enumerated on the aforementioned web page).

A single unwritten 25 gigabyte M_DISC has a data storage capacity sufficient to store all of karbytes (up to the point in time in which the “micro directory” named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_26 of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com named is determined by karbytes to be finalized (i.e. closed to further changes)).

An addition to what is described in the paragraphs above this paragraph, a single folder containing exclusively 116 (or more) unique (i.e. non-duplicate) zip files which are each downloaded from karbytes-created GitHub repositories (from the GitHub dot Com user account whose username is @karlinarayberinger) is named karbytes2024_0 (and that folder is what will be burned to three 25 gigabyte capacity M_DISCs). The contents of each of those three 25 gigabyte capacity M_DISCs is enumerated on the following web page:

Sincerely,
