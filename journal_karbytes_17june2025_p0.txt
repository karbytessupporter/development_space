Dear (Prospective) Mortals (and, by "Mortals", I mean "those who will inevitably be killed rather than selected to become immortal"),

Your existence as individual persons as well as your personal accomplishments (including art forms) will not be remembered eternally unless some immortal being has the opportunity to meticulously remember everything (because you are a subset of and causally dependent on your universe-sized (or nature sized) environment).

What you do have is the (at least temporary) ability to appreciate and to ponder the fact that you (at least temporarily) exist within that larger all-encompassing context (referred to by me as nature (which could possibly encompass more than one universe (or more than one solipsistic frame of reference and uniquely associated sequence of subjective experiences and "curated" collection of personal memories))) even though you are not assumed (by me) to have omniscience (yet or ever).

I hope that, if you do die, you have the opportunity to plan your death such that it is not physically painful for you to experience nor a serious logistical burden to other sentient beings other than yourself which may possibly survive after and while you die (and, if you do not get the opportunity to have a planned physician-assisted suicide or planned self-induced suicide, I hope your death is painless for you and not a serious logistical burden to sentient beings other than yourself which may possibly survive after and while you die).

I hope that, while you live, you do not experience what you would honestly find to be an intolerable degree of physical pain nor psychological torment. 

The following list of values may be useful to you for optimizing your use of energy and more tangible (or structured) resources while you live such that you can maximize your enjoyment of life and minimize the degree to which you and sentient beings other than yourself suffer physically or mentally: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_primary_values/

Even if you "fail" to avoid experiencing intolerable physical or mental pain or "fail" to not be a serious logistical burden to other sentient beings other than yourself which may possibly survive after and while you die (or even go so far as to personally (especially intentionally) "cause" those sentient beings other than yourself to experience what they would find to be an intolerable degree of physical pain or psychological torment), I hope that the degree of suffering which you and all other sentient beings ever experience is minimized (even if that means mortality rather than immortality is implemented (though I am hoping to find that every sentient being which dies always has the opportunity to continue the continuity of its own mind between successive incarnations if that being sincerely wants to; otherwise I hope that it is allowed to fulfill its desire to become pure nothingness for an indefinitely if not infinitely long time with the unconditional opportunity to incarcate again if it chooses to)).

I thought that it would be a good idea to document these desires of mine in written and digital form and to store this note on the public World Wide Web and, eventually, on "long term" read-only digital storage media (such as M_DISCs or something even more durable and "long lasting") because, if I make this note available to myself and other information processing agents to read in the future (whether those readings occur within a finite span of time only or within an infinitely long stretch of time with infinitely many readings possible), the desires I expressed in this note might have an increased likelihood of being fulfilled (by entities which have the ability to help me accomplish what I currently am unsure of having the ability to accomplish on my own).

Like all desires (including so-called "altruistic" desires), these desires of mine are fundamentally egoistic (which means that they fundamentally are expressions of my motivation to make myself (i.e. karbytes) survive and to thrive to a maximal extent). Perhaps this note will be useful to information processing agents other than karbytes; enabling such beings to use what I wrote to express their own desires or as scaffolding material for them to construct their own formal expressions of their own desires.

Sincerely,
karbytes
