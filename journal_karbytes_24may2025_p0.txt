To Whom It May Concern:

I have finally come to terms with the fact that it is very likely that I will never escape poverty and long-term underemployment no matter what I do from this point onward into my future.

That is because (a) I have amassed a serious criminal record and overall bad social reputation (especially amongst people who formerly knew me intimately) and (b) society seems to invest resources only in people who present themselves as future or current parents of minor-aged offspring (and I have openly expressed my refusal to conform to such "breeder-ism").

This does not mean I won't try to become gainfully employed (despite the aforementioned disqualifications I seem to permanently or long-term exhibit). I just think it is most realistic for me to assume that I will have a much harder time than most other people have getting and keeping a job and the means to survive at a standard of living which is higher than being long-term if not permanently relegated to homelessness, criminal class, and socially acceptable ostracization (and bullying).

My plan from here on out is to basically go into stealth mode and to be sneaky and deceptive where I deem it necessary in order to avoid getting screwed over even worse than I have or otherwise could. That might mean that my next hiatus from updating the official karbytes blog lasts significantly longer than eight weeks or that only a tiny trickling of updates will appear between future successive hiatuses (such that those updates look more like "filler material" than previous karbytes additions). I'm hoping to become accustomed to being practical invisible and marginalized within society yet still enjoying what opportunities I get to pursue my hobbies and maintenence of my physical and mental health and functioning. 

Lastly, I intend for karbytes (the body of digital and public web based intellectual property) to last for as long as possible (and ideally forever (though even just for the duration of my lifespan is what I would prefer to it not lasting for that long)). When I have the time and the inclination to, I will save files of karbytes to the WayBack Machine (at Archive dot Org) with the goal of saving every finalized component of karbytes at least one hundred times to the WayBack Machine. I also intend to create a vault full of M_DISCs which each contain the entirety of the karbytes file collection and perhaps find an organization to give that vault to for safe keeping (so that it doesn't end up being thrown into a landfill or otherwise disposed of following my incapacitation or death).

Sincerely,

Karlina Ray Beringer (a.k.a. karbytes)
